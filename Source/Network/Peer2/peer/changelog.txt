04-03-2003  2.01.07  DES  FIX      If maxPlayers was set to 0 in peerCreateStagingRoom[WithSocket],
                                   the qrServerKey callback was not being called for MAXPLAYERS_KEY.

                          OTHER    Changed interal IP code to use the common code's IsPrivateIP.
03-21-2003  2.01.03  DES  FEATURE  Added the ability to join a passworded title room.
                          FEATURE  Added a global (piListingGamesGroupID) to control what group ID to use

                          FIX      Switched to a new set of crypt characters for encoding IPs, the old set
                                   had both 'F' and 'f', which could cause conflicting staging room names.
                          FIX      No longer need to pass a list of fields to peerStartAutoMatch[WithSocket]().

                          CLEANUP  Changed code that used internal members of in_addr (not always fully supported).
03-12-2003  2.01.00  DES  FEATURE  Full AutoMatch support.
                          FEATURE  Added peerAlwaysGetPlayerInfo(), which is used to tell Peer to always
                                   get players' IPs and Profile IDs whether rooms are ping rooms or not.
                          FEATURE  Added the ability to host multiple staging rooms behind the same public IP.
                                   The staging room name is now based on public IP, private IP, and private queryport.
                          FEATURE  Peer now sets limits on staging rooms to allow no more than the maxPlayers.
                                   This behavior can be turned off by defining PI_NO_STAGING_ROOM_LIMIT.
                                   If maxPlayers is 0, no limit is set, and maxPlayers is not reported.

                          FEATURE  Added piSBQueryVersion global flag to set the type of server queries to send.
                          FIX      If a server is removed, clear any pending add/update calls for the same server.
                          CLEANUP  Changed _strdup() calls to goastrdup().

                          CLEANUP  Removed peerJoinStagingRoomByIP().
                          CLEANUP  Peer no longer stores passwords, it only stores whether or not one has been set.
