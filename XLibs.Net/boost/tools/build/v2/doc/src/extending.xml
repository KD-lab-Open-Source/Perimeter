      <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document explains how to extend Boost.Build to accomodate
  your local requirements. Let's start with quite simple, but
  realistic example.</para>

  <para>Say you're writing an application which generates C++ code. If
  you ever did this, you know that it's not nice. Embedding large
  portions of C++ code in string literals is very awkward. A much
  better solution is:</para>

  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <simpara>
        Write the template of the code to be generated, leaving
    placeholders at the points which will change
      </simpara>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <simpara>
        Access the template in your application and replace
    placeholders with appropriate text.
      </simpara>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <simpara>Write the result.</simpara>
    </listitem>
  </orderedlist>

  <para>It's quite easy to archive. You write special verbatim files,
  which are just C++, except that the very first line of the file
  gives a name of variable that should be generated. A simple tool
  is created which takes verbatim file and creates a cpp file with
  a single char* variable, which name is taken from the first line
  of verbatim file, and which value is properly quoted content of
  the verbatim file.</para>

  <para>Let's see what Boost.Build can do.</para>

  <para>First off, Boost.Build has no idea about "verbatim files". So,
  you must register a new type. The following code does it:</para>

<programlisting>
import type ;
type.register VERBATIM : verbatim ;
</programlisting>

  <para>The first parameter to 'type.register' gives the name of
  declared type. By convention, it's uppercase. The second
  parameter is suffix for this type. So, if Boost.Build sees
  "code.verbatim" in the list of sources, it knows that it's of
  type <literal>VERBATIM</literal>.</para>

  <para>Lastly, you need a tool to convert verbatim files to C++. Say
  you've sketched such a tool in Python. Then, you have to inform
  Boost.Build about the tool. The Boost.Build concept which
  represents a tool is <emphasis>generator</emphasis>.</para>

  <para>First, you say that generator 'inline-file' is able to convert
  VERBATIM type into C++:</para>

<programlisting>
import generators ;
generators.register-standard verbatim.inline-file : VERBATIM : CPP ;
</programlisting>

  <para>Second, you must specify the commands to be run to actually
  perform convertion:</para>

<programlisting>
actions inline-file
{
    "./inline-file.py" $(&lt;) $(&gt;)
}
</programlisting>
<!-- We use verbatim.inline-file in one place and just inline-file in
             another. Is this confusing for user?
        -->

  <para>Now, we're ready to tie it all together. Put all the code
  above in file "verbatim.jam", add "import verbatim ;" to
  "project-root.jam", and it's possible to write the following in
  Jamfile:</para>

<programlisting>
exe codegen : codegen.cpp class_template.verbatim usage.verbatim ;
</programlisting>

  <para>
The verbatim files will be automatically converted into C++
and linked it.
  </para>

  <para>The complete code is available in <ulink url=
  "../../example/customization">example/customization</ulink>
  directory.</para>
