      <title>Targets in site-config.jam</title>

  <para>It is desirable to declare standard libraries available on a
  given system. Putting target declaration in Jamfile is not really
  good, since locations of the libraries can vary. The solution is
  to put the following to site-config.jam.</para>

<programlisting>
import project ;
project.initialize $(__name__) ;
project site-config ;
lib zlib : : &lt;name&gt;z ;
</programlisting>

  <para>The second line allows this module to act as project. The
  third line gives id to this project &#x2014; it really has no location
  and cannot be used otherwise. The fourth line just declares a
  target. Now, one can write

<programlisting>
exe hello : hello.cpp /site-config//zlib ;
</programlisting>

  in any Jamfile.</para>
