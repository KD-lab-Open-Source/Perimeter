        I'm getting "Duplicate name of actual target" error. What
        does it mean?
      </title>

    <para>    
    The most likely case is that you're trying to
    compile the same file twice, with almost the same,
    but differing properties. For example:

<programlisting>
exe a : a.cpp : &lt;include&gt;/usr/local/include ;
exe b : a.cpp ;
</programlisting>    

    </para>

    <para>
    The above snippet requires two different compilations
    of 'a.cpp', which differ only in 'include' property.
    Since the 'include' property is free, Boost.Build
    can't generate two ojects files into different directories.
    On the other hand, it's dangerous to compile the file only
    once -- maybe you really want to compile with different
    includes.
    </para>

    <para>
    To solve this issue, you need to decide if file should
    be compiled once or twice.</para>

    <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
    <para>Two compile file only once, make sure that properties
      are the same:

<programlisting>
exe a : a.cpp : &lt;include&gt;/usr/local/include ;
exe b : a.cpp : &lt;include&gt;/usr/local/include ;
</programlisting></para></listitem>

    <listitem><para>
      If changing the properties is not desirable, for example
      if 'a' and 'b' target have other sources which need
      specific properties, separate 'a.cpp' into it's own target:

<programlisting>
obj a_obj : a.cpp : &lt;include&gt;/usr/local/include ;
exe a : a_obj ;
</programlisting></para></listitem>
   
      <listitem><para>
      To compile file twice, you can make the object file local
      to the main target:

<programlisting>
      exe a : [ obj a_obj : a.cpp ] : &lt;include&gt;/usr/local/include ;
      exe b : [ obj a_obj : a.cpp ] ;
</programlisting></para></listitem>

   </orderedlist>

   <para>
   A good question is why Boost.Build can't use some of the above
   approaches automatically. The problem is that such magic would
   require additional implementation complexities and would only
   help in half of the cases, while in other half we'd be silently
   doing the wrong thing. It's simpler and safe to ask user to
   clarify his intention in such cases.
