    <h2><a name="sec-intro">Introduction for users</a></h2>

    <p>The testing system for Boost.Build is a small set of Python modules
    and scripts for automatically testing user-obversable behaviour. It uses
    components from testing systems of <a href=
    "http://www.scons.org">Scons</a> and <a href=
    "http://subversion.tigris.org">Subverion</a>, together with some
    additional functionality.</p>

    <p>To run the tests you'd need:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Get the source tree of Boost.Build (located at <tt>tools/build</tt>
      in Boost)</li>

      <li>Have <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> installed. Version
      2.1 is known to work.</li>

      <li>Build Boost.Jam. See <a href=
      "../../jam_src/index.html">$boost_build_root/jam_src/index.html</a> for
      instructions.</li>

      <li>Configure at least one toolset. You can edit
      <tt>site-config.jam</tt> or <tt>user-config.jam</tt> to add new
      toolsets. Or you can create file <tt>test-config.jam</tt> in
      <tt>$boost_build_root/test</tt> directory. In this case,
      <tt>site-config.jam</tt> and <tt>user-config.jam</tt> will be ignored
      for testing.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>When all is done, you can run the tests with</p>
<pre class="code">
python test_all.py
</pre>

    <p>which will use the default toolset, or you can specify toolset on the
    command line, for example:</p>
<pre class="code">
python test_all.py borland
</pre>

    <p>If everything's OK, you'll see a list of passed tests. Otherwise, a
    failure will be reported.</p>

    <p>It is possible to run a specific test, for example:</p>
<pre class="code">
python generators_test.py
</pre>

    <h2><a name="sec-developers">Introduction for developers</a></h2>

    <p>It is suggested that every new functionality come together with tests,
    and that bugfixes are accompanied by tests. There's no need to say that
    tests are good, but two points are extremely important:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>For an interpreted language like Jam, without any static checks,
      testing is simply the only sefeguard we can have.</li>

      <li>Good tests allow to change internal design much more safely, and we
      didn't nailed everything down yet.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Adding a new test is simple:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Go to <tt>$boost_build_root/test/test_all.py</tt> and add new test
      name to the list at the end of file. Suppose the test name is
      "hello".</li>

      <li>Add a new python module, in this example "hello.py", to do actual
      testing.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The module, in general will perform these basic actions:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Setting the initial working directory state</li>

      <li>
        Running the build system and checking: 

        <ol>
          <li>generated output,</li>

          <li>changes made to the working directory,</li>

          <li>new content of the working directory.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>Adding, removing or touching files, or changing their content and
      then repeating the previous step, until satisfied.</li>

      <li>Cleaning up</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The "hello.py" module might contain:</p>
<pre class="example">
from BoostBuild import Tester, List

# Create a temporary working directory
t = Tester()

# Create the needed files
t.write("project-root.jam", "")
t.write("Jamfile", """
exe hello : hello.cpp ;
""")
t.write("hello.cpp", """
int main()
{
    return 0;
}

""")

t.run_build_system()

# First, create a list of three pathnames
file_list = List("bin/$toolset/debug/") * List("hello.exe hello.obj")
# Second, assert that those files were added as result of the last build system invocation.
t.expect_addition(file_list)

# Invoke the build system once again
t.run_build_system("clean")
# Check if the files added previously were removed.
t.expect_removal(file_list)

# Remove temporary directories
t.cleanup()
</pre>

    <p>The <tt>test</tt> directory contains a file "template.py" which can be
    used as a start for your own tests.</p>

    <p>Overview of the most important methods of class
    <tt>TestBoostBuild</tt> follows.</p>

    <h3><a name="sec-intro-changing">Changing the working directory</a></h3>

    <p>The class <tt>TestBoostBuild</tt> creates a temporary directory in its
    constructor and changes to that directory. It can be modified by calling
    these methods:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><tt>set_tree</tt> -- sets the content of the working directory to
      be equal to the content of the specified directory. This method is
      preferrable when directory tree for testing is large.</li>

      <li><tt>write</tt> -- sets the content of file in a working directory.
      This is optimal if you want to create a directory tree with 3-4 small
      files.</li>

      <li><tt>touch</tt> -- changes the modification times of a file</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="sec-intro-examining">Examining the working directory and
    changing it</a></h3>

    <p>The method <tt>read</tt>, inherited from the <tt>TestCmd</tt> class,
    can be used to read any file in the working directory and check its
    content. <tt>TestBoostBuild</tt> adds another method for tracking
    changes. Whenever build system is run (via <tt>run_build_system</tt>),
    the state of working dir before and after running is recorded. In
    addition, difference between the two states -- i.e. lists of files that
    were added, removed, modified or touched -- is stored in two member
    variables, <tt>tree_difference</tt> and
    <tt>unexpected_difference</tt>.</p>

    <p>After than, the test author may specify that some change is expected,
    for example, by calling <tt>expect_addition("foo")</tt>. This call will
    check if the file was indeed added, and if so, will remove its name from
    the list of added files in <tt>unexpected_difference</tt>. Likewise, it's
    possible to specify that some changes are not interesting, for example a
    call <tt>ignore("*.obj")</tt> will just remove every files with ".obj"
    extension from <tt>unexpected_difference</tt>.</p>

    <p>When test has finished with expectations and ignoring, the member
    <tt>unexpected_difference</tt> will contain the list of all changes not
    yet accounted for. It is possible to assure that this list is empty by
    calling <tt>expect_nothing_more</tt> member function.</p>

    <h3><a name="sec-intro-results">Test result</a></h3>

    <p>Any of the <tt>expect*</tt> methods below will fail the test if the
    expectation is not met. It is also possible to perform manually arbitrary
    test and explicitly cause the test to either pass or fail. Ordinary
    filesystem functions can be used to work with the directory tree. Methods
    <tt>pass_test</tt> and <tt>fail_test</tt> are used to explicitly give the
    test outcome.</p>

    <p>Typically, after test termination, the working directory is erased. To
    debug a failed test, you should add "--preserve" option when invoking
    test. On failure, the working directory will be copied to "failed_test"
    directory in the current dir.</p>

    <h2 id="sec-reference">Reference documentation</h2>

    <p>The test system is composed of class <tt>Tester</tt>, derived form
    <tt>TestCmd.TestCmd</tt>, and helper class <tt>List</tt>. The methods of
    <tt>Tester</tt>, and the class <tt>List</tt> are described below.</p>

    <p>The documentation frequently refer to filename. In all cases, files
    are specified in unix style: a sequence of components, separated by "/".
    This is true on all platforms. In some contexts, a list of files is
    allowed. In that case any object with sequence interface is allowed.</p>

    <h3><a name="method-__init__">Method <tt>__init__(self, arguments='',
    executable='bjam')</tt></a></h3>

    <p><b>Effects:</b></p>

    <ol>
      <li>Remembers the current working directory in member
      <tt>original_workdir</tt>.</li>

      <li>Determines the location of executable (<code>bjam</code> by
      default) and build system files, assuming that the current directory is
      <tt>tools/build/test</tt>. Formulates jam invocation command, which
      will include explicit setting for <tt>BOOST_BUILD_PATH</tt> variable
      and arguments passed to this methods, if any. This command will be used
      by subsequent invocation of <a href=
      "#method-run_build_system"><tt>run_build_system</tt></a>. Finally,
      initializes the base class.</li>

      <li>Changes current working dir to the temporary working directory
      created by the base constructor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="method-set_tree">Method <tt>set_tree(self,
    tree_location)</tt></a></h3>

    <p><b>Effects:</b></p>

    <p>Replaces the content of the current working directory with the content
    of directory at <tt>tree_location</tt>. If <tt>tree_location</tt> is not
    absolute pathname, it will be treated as relative to
    <tt>self.original_workdir</tt>. This methods also explicitly makes the
    copied files writeable.</p>

    <h3><a name="method-write">Method <tt>write(self, name,
    content)</tt></a></h3>

    <p><b>Effects:</b></p>

    <p>Writes the specified content to the file given by <tt>name</tt> under
    the temporary working directory. If the file already exists, it is
    overwritten. Any required directories are automatically created.</p>

    <h3><a name="method-copy">Method <tt>copy(self, src, dst)</tt></a></h3>

    <p><b>Effects:</b></p>

    <p>Equvivalent to <tt>self.write(self.read(src), dst)</tt>.</p>

    <h3><a name="method-touch">Method <tt>touch(self, names)</tt></a></h3>

    <p><b>Effects:</b></p>

    <p>Sets the access and modification times for all files in <tt>names</tt>
    to the current time. All the elements in <tt>names</tt> should be
    relative paths.</p>

    <h3><a name="method-run_build_system">Method <tt>run_build_system(self,
    subdir='', extra_args='', stdout=None, stderr='', status=0,
    **kw)</tt></a></h3>

    <p><b>Effects:</b></p>

    <ol>
      <li>Stores the state of the working directory in
      <tt>self.previous_tree</tt>.</li>

      <li>Changes to <tt>subdir</tt>, if it is specified. If it is not
      absolute path, it is relative to the working dir.</li>

      <li>Invokes the <tt>bjam</tt> executable, passing <tt>extra_args</tt>
      to it. The binary should be located under
      <tt>&lt;test_invocation_dir&gt;/../jam_src/bin.&lt;platform&gt;</tt>.
      This is to make sure tests use the version of jam build from CVS.</li>

      <li>Compares the stdout, stderr and exit status of build system
      invocation with values to appropriate parameters, if they are not
      <tt>None</tt>. If any difference is found, the test fails.</li>

      <li>
        <p>Stores the new state of the working directory in
        <tt>self.tree</tt>. Computes the difference between previous and
        current trees and store them in variables
        <tt>self.tree_difference</tt> and
        <tt>self.unexpected_difference</tt>.</p>

        <p>Both variables are instances of class
        <tt>tree.Trees_different</tt>, which have four attributes:
        <tt>added_files</tt>, <tt>removed_files</tt>, <tt>modified_files</tt>
        and <tt>touched_files</tt>. Each is a list of strings.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="method-read">Method <tt>read(self, name)</tt></a></h3>

    <p><b>Effects:</b></p>

    <p>Read the specified file and returns it content. Raises an exception is
    the file is absent.</p>

    <h3><a name="method-read_and_strip">Method <tt>read_and_strip(self,
    name)</tt></a></h3>

    <p><b>Effects:</b></p>

    <p>Read the specified file and returns it content, after removing
    trailing whitespace from every line. Raises an exception is the file is
    absent.</p>

    <p><b>Rationale:</b></p>

    <p>Althought this method is questionable, there are a lot of cases when
    jam or shells it uses insert spaces. It seems that introducing this
    method is much simpler than dealing with all those cases.</p>

    <h3><a name="methods-expectations">Methods for declaring
    expectations</a></h3>

    <p>Accordingly to the number of changes kinds that are detected, there
    are four methods that specify that test author expects a specific change
    to occur. They check <tt>self.unexpected_difference</tt>, and if the
    change is present there, it is removed. Otherwise, test fails.</p>

    <p>Each method accepts a list of names. Those names use <tt>/</tt> path
    separator on all systems. Additionaly, the test system translates
    suffixes appropriately. For the test to be portable, suffixes should use
    Windows convention: <tt>exe</tt> for executables, <tt>dll</tt> for
    dynamic libraries and <tt>lib</tt> for static libraries. Lastly, the
    string "$toolset" in file names is replaced by the name of tested
    toolset.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> The <tt>List</tt> helper class might be useful to create
    lists of names.</p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> The file content can be examined using
    <tt>TestCmd.read</tt> function.</p>

    <p>The members are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>expect_addition</li>

      <li>expect_removal</li>

      <li>expect_modification</li>

      <li>expect_nothing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note that <tt>expect_modification</tt> is used to check that a either
    file content or timestamp has changed. The rationale is that some
    compilers change content even if sources does not change, and it's easier
    to have a method which checks for both content and time changes.</p>

    <p>There's also a member <tt>expect_nothing_more</tt>, which checks that
    all the changes are either expected or ignored, in other words that
    <tt>unexpected_difference</tt> is empty by now.</p>

    <p>Lastly, there's a method to compare file content with expected
    content:</p>
    <tt>expect_content(self, name, content, exact=0)</tt> 

    <p>The method fails the test if the content of file identified by 'name'
    is different from 'content'. If 'exact' is true, the file content is used
    as-is, otherwise, two transformations are applied:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The <tt>read_and_strip</tt> method is used to read the file, which
      removes trailing whitespace</li>

      <li>Each backslash in the file content is converted to forward
      slash.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a name="methods-ignoring">Methods for ignoring changes</a></h3>

    <p>There are five methods which ignore changes made to the working tree.
    They silently remove elements from <tt>self.unexpected_difference</tt>,
    and don't generate error if element is not found. They accept shell style
    wildcard.</p>

    <p>The following methods correspond to four kinds of changes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>ignore_addition(self, wildcard)</li>

      <li>ignore_removal(self, wildcard)</li>

      <li>ignore_modification(self, wildcard)</li>

      <li>ignore_touch(self, wilcard)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The method <tt>ignore(self, wildcard)</tt> ignores all the changes
    made to files that match a wildcard.</p>

    <h3><a name="methods-result">Methods for explicitly specifying
    results</a></h3>

    <h4>Method <tt>pass_test(self, condition=1)</tt></h4>

    <div class="attention">
      At this moment, the method should not be used.
    </div>

    <h4>Method <tt>fail_test(self, condition=1)</tt></h4>

    <p><b>Effects:</b> Cause the test to fail if <tt>condition</tt> is
    true.</p>

    <h3><a name="class-list">Helper class <tt>List</tt></a></h3>
    The class has sequence interface and two additional methods. 

    <h4>Method <tt>__init__(self, string)</tt></h4>

    <p><b>Effects:</b> Splits the string on unescaped spaces and tabs. The
    split components can further be retrieved using standard sequence
    access.</p>

    <h4>Method <tt>__mul__(self, other)</tt></h4>

    <p><b>Effects:</b> Returns an <tt>List</tt> instance, which elements are
    all possible concatenations of two string, first of which is from
    <tt>self</tt>, and second of which is from <tt>other</tt>.</p>

    <p>The class also defines <tt>__str__</tt> and <tt>__repr__</tt> methods.
    Finally, there's <tt>__coerce__</tt> method which allows to convert
    strings to instances of <tt>List</tt>.</p>

    <p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre>
    l = "a b" * List("c d")
    for e in l:
        print e        
   
</pre>

    <p>will output</p>
<pre>
    ac
    ad
    bc
    bd
