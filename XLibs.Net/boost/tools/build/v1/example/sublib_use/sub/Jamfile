# Declare an executable target that uses the library.
# Here the executable has a single source file, but also
# depends on the above library. Therefore this executable
# has the additional source file as generated by the library
# target.
#
# This target also specifies the requirement that it be built
# as multi-threaded. This also forces which variant of the library
# is used, and in this case, regardless of the build requested on this
# target.
