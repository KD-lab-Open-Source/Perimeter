<h1><img src="../../c++boost.gif" width="276" height="86">Header
&lt;<a href="../../boost/static_assert.hpp">boost/static_assert.hpp</a>&gt;</h1>

<p>The header &lt;boost/static_assert.hpp&gt; supplies a single
macro BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(x), which generates a compile time
error message if the <a
href="../../more/int_const_guidelines.htm">integral-constant-expression</a>
<i>x</i> is not true. In other words it is the compile time
equivalent of the assert macro; this is sometimes known as a
&quot;compile-time-assertion&quot;, but will be called a &quot;static
assertion&quot; throughout these docs. Note that if the condition
is true, then the macro will generate neither code nor data - and
the macro can also be used at either namespace, class or function
scope. When used in a template, the static assertion will be
evaluated at the time the template is instantiated; this is
particularly useful for validating template parameters. </p>

<p>One of the aims of BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT is to generate readable
error messages. These immediately tell the user that a library is
being used in a manner that is not supported. While error
messages obviously differ from compiler to compiler, but you
should see something like: </p>

<pre>Illegal use of COMPILE_TIME_ASSERTION_FAILURE&lt;false&gt;</pre>

<p>Which is intended to at least catch the eye!</p>

<p>You can use BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT at any place where you can
place a declaration, that is at <a href="#class">class</a>, <a
href="#function">function</a> or <a href="#namespace">namespace</a>
scope, this is illustrated by the following examples:</p>

<h3><a name="namespace"></a>Use at namespace scope.</h3>

<p>The macro can be used at namespace scope, if there is some
requirement must always be true; generally this means some
platform specific requirement. Suppose we require that <b>int</b>
be at least a 32-bit integral type, and that <b>wchar_t</b> be an
unsigned type. We can verify this at compile time as follows:</p>

<pre>#include &lt;climits&gt;
#include &lt;cwchar&gt;
#include &lt;boost/static_assert.hpp&gt;

namespace my_conditions {

BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(sizeof(int) * CHAR_BIT &gt;= 32);
BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(WCHAR_MIN &gt;= 0);

} // namespace my_conditions
</pre>

<p>The use of the namespace <i>my_conditions</i> here requires
some comment. The macro BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT works by generating
an <strong>typedef</strong> declaration, and since the typedef
must have a name, the macro generates one automatically by
mangling a stub name with the value of __LINE__. When
BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT is used at either class or function scope
then each use of BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT is guaranteed to produce a
name unique to that scope (provided you only use the macro once
on each line). However when used in a header at namespace scope,
that namespace can be continued over multiple headers, each of
which may have their own static assertions, and on the &quot;same&quot;
lines, thereby generating duplicate declarations. In theory the
compiler should silently ignore duplicate typedef declarations,
however many do not do so (and even if they do they are entitled
to emit warnings in such cases). To avoid potential problems, if
you use BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT in a header and at namespace scope,
then enclose them in a namespace unique to that header.</p>

<h3><a name="function"></a>Use at function scope</h3>

<p>The macro is typically used at function scope inside template
functions, when the template arguments need checking. Imagine
that we have an iterator-based algorithm that requires random
access iterators. If the algorithm is instantiated with iterators
that do not meet our requirements then an error will be generated
eventually, but this may be nested deep inside several templates,
making it hard for the user to determine what went wrong. One
option is to add a static assertion at the top level of the
template, in that case if the condition is not met, then an error
will be generated in a way that makes it reasonably obvious to
the user that the template is being misused.</p>

<pre>#include &lt;iterator&gt;
#include &lt;boost/static_assert.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/type_traits.hpp&gt;

template &lt;class RandomAccessIterator &gt;
RandomAccessIterator foo(RandomAccessIterator from, RandomAccessIterator to)
{
   // this template can only be used with
   // random access iterators...
   typedef typename std::iterator_traits&lt; RandomAccessIterator &gt;::iterator_category cat;
   BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT((boost::is_convertible&lt;cat, const std::random_access_iterator_tag&amp;&gt;::value));
   //
   // detail goes here...
   return from;
}</pre>

<p>A couple of footnotes are in order here: the extra set of
parenthesis around the assert, is to prevent the comma inside the
is_convertible template being interpreted by the preprocessor as
a macro argument separator; the target type for is_convertible is
a reference type, as some compilers have problems using
is_convertible when the conversion is via a user defined
constructor (in any case there is no guarantee that the iterator
tag classes are copy-constructible).</p>

<h3><a name="class"></a>Use at class scope</h3>

<p>The macro is typically used inside classes that are templates.
Suppose we have a template-class that requires an unsigned
integral type with at least 16-bits of precision as a template
argument, we can achieve this using something like this:</p>

<pre>#include &lt;climits&gt;
#include &lt;boost/static_assert.hpp&gt;

template &lt;class UnsignedInt&gt;
class myclass
{
private:
   BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(sizeof(UnsignedInt) * CHAR_BIT &gt;= 16);
   BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(std::numeric_limits&lt;UnsignedInt&gt;::is_specialized
                        &amp;&amp; std::numeric_limits&lt;UnsignedInt&gt;::is_integer
                        &amp;&amp; !std::numeric_limits&lt;UnsignedInt&gt;::is_signed);
public:
   /* details here */
};
</pre>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT works as follows. There is class
STATIC_ASSERTION_FAILURE which is defined as:</p>

<pre>namespace boost{

template &lt;bool&gt; struct STATIC_ASSERTION_FAILURE;

template &lt;&gt; struct STATIC_ASSERTION_FAILURE&lt;true&gt;{};

}</pre>

<p>The key feature is that the error message triggered by the
undefined expression sizeof(STATIC_ASSERTION_FAILURE&lt;0&gt;),
tends to be consistent across a wide variety of compilers. The
rest of the machinery of BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT is just a way to
feed the sizeof expression into a typedef. The use of a macro
here is somewhat ugly; however boost members have spent
considerable effort trying to invent a static assert that avoided
macros, all to no avail. The general conclusion was that the good
of a static assert working at namespace, function, and class
scope outweighed the ugliness of a macro.</p>
