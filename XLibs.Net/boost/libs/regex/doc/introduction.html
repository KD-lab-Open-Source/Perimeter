      <P>Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often used in text 
         processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix utilities <I>grep</I>, <I>sed</I>
         and <I>awk</I>, and the programming language <I>Perl</I>, each of which make 
         extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++ users have been limited 
         to the POSIX C API's for manipulating regular expressions, and while regex++ 
         does provide these API's, they do not represent the best way to use the 
         library. For example regex++ can cope with wide character strings, or search 
         and replace operations (in a manner analogous to either sed or Perl), something 
         that traditional C libraries can not do.</P>
      <P>The class <A href="basic_regex.html">boost::basic_regex</A> is the key class in 
         this library; it represents a "machine readable" regular expression, and is 
         very closely modeled on std::basic_string, think of it as a string plus the 
         actual state-machine required by the regular expression algorithms. Like 
         std::basic_string there are two typedefs that are almost always the means by 
         which this class is referenced:</P>
      <pre><B>namespace </B>boost{

<B>template</B> &lt;<B>class</B> charT, 
<B>          class</B> traits = regex_traits&lt;charT&gt;, 
          <B>class</B> Allocator = std::allocator&lt;charT&gt; &gt;
<B>class</B> basic_regex;

<B>typedef</B> basic_regex&lt;<B>char</B>&gt; regex;
<B>typedef</B> basic_regex&lt;<B>wchar_t&gt;</B> wregex;

}</pre>
      <P>To see how this library can be used, imagine that we are writing a credit card 
         processing application. Credit card numbers generally come as a string of 
         16-digits, separated into groups of 4-digits, and separated by either a space 
         or a hyphen. Before storing a credit card number in a database (not necessarily 
         something your customers will appreciate!), we may want to verify that the 
         number is in the correct format. To match any digit we could use the regular 
         expression [0-9], however ranges of characters like this are actually locale 
         dependent. Instead we should use the POSIX standard form [[:digit:]], or the 
         regex++ and Perl shorthand for this \d (note that many older libraries tended 
         to be hard-coded to the C-locale, consequently this was not an issue for them). 
         That leaves us with the following regular expression to validate credit card 
         number formats:</P>
      <PRE>(\d{4}[- ]){3}\d{4}</PRE>
      <P>Here the parenthesis act to group (and mark for future reference) 
         sub-expressions, and the {4} means "repeat exactly 4 times". This is an example 
         of the extended regular expression syntax used by Perl, awk and egrep. Regex++ 
         also supports the older "basic" syntax used by sed and grep, but this is 
         generally less useful, unless you already have some basic regular expressions 
         that you need to reuse.</P>
      <P>Now let's take that expression and place it in some C++ code to validate the 
         format of a credit card number:</P>
      <PRE><B>bool</B> validate_card_format(<B>const</B> std::string s)
{
   <B>static</B> <B>const</B> <A href="basic_regex.html">boost::regex</A> e("(\\d{4}[- ]){3}\\d{4}");
   <B>return</B> <A href="regex_match.html">regex_match</A>(s, e);
}</PRE>
      <P>Note how we had to add some extra escapes to the expression: remember that the 
         escape is seen once by the C++ compiler, before it gets to be seen by the 
         regular expression engine, consequently escapes in regular expressions have to 
         be doubled up when embedding them in C/C++ code. Also note that all the 
         examples assume that your compiler supports Koenig lookup, if yours doesn't 
         (for example VC6), then you will have to add some boost:: prefixes to some of 
         the function calls in the examples.</P>
      <P>Those of you who are familiar with credit card processing, will have realized 
         that while the format used above is suitable for human readable card numbers, 
         it does not represent the format required by online credit card systems; these 
         require the number as a string of 16 (or possibly 15) digits, without any 
         intervening spaces. What we need is a means to convert easily between the two 
         formats, and this is where search and replace comes in. Those who are familiar 
         with the utilities <I>sed</I> and <I>Perl</I> will already be ahead here; we 
         need two strings - one a regular expression - the other a "<A href="format_syntax.html">format 
            string</A>" that provides a description of the text to replace the match 
         with. In regex++ this search and replace operation is performed with the 
         algorithm<A href="regex_replace.html"> regex_replace</A>, for our credit card 
         example we can write two algorithms like this to provide the format 
         conversions:</P>
      <PRE><I>// match any format with the regular expression:
</I><B>const</B> boost::regex e("\\A(\\d{3,4})[- ]?(\\d{4})[- ]?(\\d{4})[- ]?(\\d{4})\\z");
<B>const</B> std::string machine_format("\\1\\2\\3\\4");
<B>const</B> std::string human_format("\\1-\\2-\\3-\\4");

std::string machine_readable_card_number(<B>const</B> std::string s)
{
   <B>return</B> <A href="regex_replace.html">regex_replace</A>(s, e, machine_format, boost::match_default | boost::format_sed);
}

std::string human_readable_card_number(<B>const</B> std::string s)
{
   <B>return</B> <A href="regex_replace.html">regex_replace</A>(s, e, human_format, boost::match_default | boost::format_sed);
}</PRE>
      <P>Here we've used marked sub-expressions in the regular expression to split out 
         the four parts of the card number as separate fields, the format string then 
         uses the sed-like syntax to replace the matched text with the reformatted 
         version.</P>
      <P>In the examples above, we haven't directly manipulated the results of a regular 
         expression match, however in general the result of a match contains a number of 
         sub-expression matches in addition to the overall match. When the library needs 
         to report a regular expression match it does so using an instance of the class <A href="match_results.html">
            match_results</A>, as before there are typedefs of this class for the most 
         common cases:
      </P>
      <PRE><B>namespace </B>boost{
<B>typedef</B> match_results&lt;<B>const</B> <B>char</B>*&gt; cmatch;
<B>typedef</B> match_results&lt;<B>const</B> <B>wchar_t</B>*&gt; wcmatch;
<STRONG>typedef</STRONG> match_results&lt;std::string::const_iterator&gt; smatch;
<STRONG>typedef</STRONG> match_results&lt;std::wstring::const_iterator&gt; wsmatch; 
}</PRE>
      <P>The algorithms <A href="regex_search.html">regex_search</A> and&nbsp;<A href="regex_match.html">regex_match</A>
         make use of match_results to report what matched; the difference between these 
         algorithms is that <A href="regex_match.html">regex_match</A> will only find 
         matches that consume <EM>all</EM> of the input text, where as <A href="regex_search.html">
            regex_search</A> will <EM>search</EM> for a match anywhere within the text 
         being matched.</P>
      <P>Note that these algorithms are not restricted to searching regular C-strings, 
         any bidirectional iterator type can be searched, allowing for the possibility 
         of seamlessly searching almost any kind of data.
      </P>
      <P>For search and replace operations, in addition to the algorithm <A href="regex_replace.html">
            regex_replace</A> that we have already seen, the <A href="match_results.html">match_results</A>
         class has a format member that takes the result of a match and a format string, 
         and produces a new string by merging the two.</P>
      <P>For iterating through all occurences of an expression within a text, there are 
         two iterator types: <A href="regex_iterator.html">regex_iterator</A> will 
         enumerate over the <A href="match_results.html">match_results</A> objects 
         found, while <A href="regex_token_iterator.html">regex_token_iterator</A> will 
         enumerate a series of strings (similar to perl style split operations).</P>
      <P>For those that dislike templates, there is a high level wrapper class RegEx 
         that is an encapsulation of the lower level template code - it provides a 
         simplified interface for those that don't need the full power of the library, 
         and supports only narrow characters, and the "extended" regular expression 
         syntax. This class is now deprecated as it does not form part of the regular 
         expressions C++ standard library proposal.
      </P>
      <P>The <A href="posix_api.html">POSIX API</A> functions: regcomp, regexec, regfree 
         and regerror, are available in both narrow character and Unicode versions, and 
         are provided for those who need compatibility with these API's.
      </P>
      <P>Finally, note that the library now has run-time <A href="localisation.html">localization</A>
         support, and recognizes the full POSIX regular expression syntax - including 
         advanced features like multi-character collating elements and equivalence 
         classes - as well as providing compatibility with other regular expression 
         libraries including GNU and BSD4 regex packages, and to a more limited extent 
         Perl 5.
