      <HR>
      <P>This section covers the regular expression syntax used by this library, this is 
         a programmers guide, the actual syntax presented to your program's users will 
         depend upon the flags used during expression compilation.
      </P>
      <H3>Literals
      </H3>
      <P>All characters are literals except: ".", "|", "*", "?", "+", "(", ")", "{", 
         "}", "[", "]", "^", "$" and "\". These characters are literals when preceded by 
         a "\". A literal is a character that matches itself, or matches the result of 
         traits_type::translate(), where traits_type is the traits template parameter to 
         class basic_regex.</P>
      <H3>Wildcard
      </H3>
      <P>The dot character "." matches any single character except : when <I>match_not_dot_null</I>
         is passed to the matching algorithms, the dot does not match a null character; 
         when <I>match_not_dot_newline</I> is passed to the matching algorithms, then 
         the dot does not match a newline character.
      </P>
      <H3>Repeats
      </H3>
      <P>A repeat is an expression that is repeated an arbitrary number of times. An 
         expression followed by "*" can be repeated any number of times including zero. 
         An expression followed by "+" can be repeated any number of times, but at least 
         once, if the expression is compiled with the flag regex_constants::bk_plus_qm 
         then "+" is an ordinary character and "\+" represents a repeat of once or more. 
         An expression followed by "?" may be repeated zero or one times only, if the 
         expression is compiled with the flag regex_constants::bk_plus_qm then "?" is an 
         ordinary character and "\?" represents the repeat zero or once operator. When 
         it is necessary to specify the minimum and maximum number of repeats 
         explicitly, the bounds operator "{}" may be used, thus "a{2}" is the letter "a" 
         repeated exactly twice, "a{2,4}" represents the letter "a" repeated between 2 
         and 4 times, and "a{2,}" represents the letter "a" repeated at least twice with 
         no upper limit. Note that there must be no white-space inside the {}, and there 
         is no upper limit on the values of the lower and upper bounds. When the 
         expression is compiled with the flag regex_constants::bk_braces then "{" and 
         "}" are ordinary characters and "\{" and "\}" are used to delimit bounds 
         instead. All repeat expressions refer to the shortest possible previous 
         sub-expression: a single character; a character set, or a sub-expression 
         grouped with "()" for example.
      </P>
      <P>Examples:
      </P>
      <P>"ba*" will match all of "b", "ba", "baaa" etc.
      </P>
      <P>"ba+" will match "ba" or "baaaa" for example but not "b".
      </P>
      <P>"ba?" will match "b" or "ba".
      </P>
      <P>"ba{2,4}" will match "baa", "baaa" and "baaaa".
      </P>
      <H3>Non-greedy repeats
      </H3>
      <P>Whenever the "extended" regular expression syntax is in use (the default) then 
         non-greedy repeats are possible by appending a '?' after the repeat; a 
         non-greedy repeat is one which will match the <I>shortest</I> possible string.
      </P>
      <P>For example to match html tag pairs one could use something like:
      </P>
      <P>"&lt;\s*tagname[^&gt;]*&gt;(.*?)&lt;\s*/tagname\s*&gt;"
      </P>
      <P>In this case $1 will contain the text between the tag pairs, and will be the 
         shortest possible matching string.&nbsp;
      </P>
      <H3>Parenthesis
      </H3>
      <P>Parentheses serve two purposes, to group items together into a sub-expression, 
         and to mark what generated the match. For example the expression "(ab)*" would 
         match all of the string "ababab". The matching algorithms <A href="regex_match.html">
            regex_match</A> and <A href="regex_search.html">regex_search</A> each take 
         an instance of <A href="match_results.html">match_results</A> that reports what 
         caused the match, on exit from these functions the <A href="match_results.html">match_results</A>
         contains information both on what the whole expression matched and on what each 
         sub-expression matched. In the example above match_results[1] would contain a 
         pair of iterators denoting the final "ab" of the matching string. It is 
         permissible for sub-expressions to match null strings. If a sub-expression 
         takes no part in a match - for example if it is part of an alternative that is 
         not taken - then both of the iterators that are returned for that 
         sub-expression point to the end of the input string, and the <I>matched</I> parameter 
         for that sub-expression is <I>false</I>. Sub-expressions are indexed from left 
         to right starting from 1, sub-expression 0 is the whole expression.
      </P>
      <H3>Non-Marking Parenthesis
      </H3>
      <P>Sometimes you need to group sub-expressions with parenthesis, but don't want 
         the parenthesis to spit out another marked sub-expression, in this case a 
         non-marking parenthesis (?:expression) can be used. For example the following 
         expression creates no sub-expressions:
      </P>
      <P>"(?:abc)*"</P>
      <H3>Forward Lookahead Asserts&nbsp;
      </H3>
      <P>There are two forms of these; one for positive forward lookahead asserts, and 
         one for negative lookahead asserts:</P>
      <P>"(?=abc)" matches zero characters only if they are followed by the expression 
         "abc".</P>
      <P>"(?!abc)" matches zero characters only if they are not followed by the 
         expression "abc".</P>
      <H3>Independent sub-expressions</H3>
      <P>"(?&gt;expression)" matches "expression" as an independent atom (the algorithm 
         will not backtrack into it if a failure occurs later in the expression).</P>
      <H3>Alternatives
      </H3>
      <P>Alternatives occur when the expression can match either one sub-expression or 
         another, each alternative is separated by a "|", or a "\|" if the flag 
         regex_constants::bk_vbar is set, or by a newline character if the flag 
         regex_constants::newline_alt is set. Each alternative is the largest possible 
         previous sub-expression; this is the opposite behavior from repetition 
         operators.
      </P>
      <P>Examples:
      </P>
      <P>"a(b|c)" could match "ab" or "ac".
      </P>
      <P>"abc|def" could match "abc" or "def".
      </P>
      <H3>Sets
      </H3>
      <P>A set is a set of characters that can match any single character that is a 
         member of the set. Sets are delimited by "[" and "]" and can contain literals, 
         character ranges, character classes, collating elements and equivalence 
         classes. Set declarations that start with "^" contain the complement of the 
         elements that follow.
      </P>
      <P>Examples:
      </P>
      <P>Character literals:
      </P>
      <P>"[abc]" will match either of "a", "b", or "c".
      </P>
      <P>"[^abc] will match any character other than "a", "b", or "c".
      </P>
      <P>Character ranges:
      </P>
      <P>"[a-z]" will match any character in the range "a" to "z".
      </P>
      <P>"[^A-Z]" will match any character other than those in the range "A" to "Z".
      </P>
      <P>Note that character ranges are highly locale dependent if the flag 
         regex_constants::collate is set: they match any character that collates between 
         the endpoints of the range, ranges will only behave according to ASCII rules 
         when the default "C" locale is in effect. For example if the library is 
         compiled with the Win32 localization model, then [a-z] will match the ASCII 
         characters a-z, and also 'A', 'B' etc, but not 'Z' which collates just after 
         'z'. This locale specific behavior is disabled by default (in perl mode), and 
         forces ranges to collate according to ASCII character code.
      </P>
      <P>Character classes are denoted using the syntax "[:classname:]" within a set 
         declaration, for example "[[:space:]]" is the set of all whitespace characters. 
         Character classes are only available if the flag regex_constants::char_classes 
         is set. The available character classes are:

      </P>
      <P>There are some shortcuts that can be used in place of the character classes, 
         provided the flag regex_constants::escape_in_lists is set then you can use:
      </P>
      <P>\w in place of [:word:]
      </P>
      <P>\s in place of [:space:]
      </P>
      <P>\d in place of [:digit:]
      </P>
      <P>\l in place of [:lower:]
      </P>
      <P>\u in place of [:upper:]&nbsp;
      </P>
      <P>Collating elements take the general form [.tagname.] inside a set declaration, 
         where <I>tagname</I> is either a single character, or a name of a collating 
         element, for example [[.a.]] is equivalent to [a], and [[.comma.]] is 
         equivalent to [,]. The library supports all the standard POSIX collating 
         element names, and in addition the following digraphs: "ae", "ch", "ll", "ss", 
         "nj", "dz", "lj", each in lower, upper and title case variations. 
         Multi-character collating elements can result in the set matching more than one 
         character, for example [[.ae.]] would match two characters, but note that 
         [^[.ae.]] would only match one character.&nbsp;
      </P>
      <P>
         Equivalence classes take the generalform[=tagname=] inside a set declaration, 
         where <I>tagname</I> is either a single character, or a name of a collating 
         element, and matches any character that is a member of the same primary 
         equivalence class as the collating element [.tagname.]. An equivalence class is 
         a set of characters that collate the same, a primary equivalence class is a set 
         of characters whose primary sort key are all the same (for example strings are 
         typically collated by character, then by accent, and then by case; the primary 
         sort key then relates to the character, the secondary to the accentation, and 
         the tertiary to the case). If there is no equivalence class corresponding to <I>tagname</I>
         ,then[=tagname=] is exactly the same as [.tagname.]. Unfortunately there is no 
         locale independent method of obtaining the primary sort key for a character, 
         except under Win32. For other operating systems the library will "guess" the 
         primary sort key from the full sort key (obtained from <I>strxfrm</I>), so 
         equivalence classes are probably best considered broken under any operating 
         system other than Win32.&nbsp;
      </P>
      <P>To include a literal "-" in a set declaration then: make it the first character 
         after the opening "[" or "[^", the endpoint of a range, a collating element, or 
         if the flag regex_constants::escape_in_lists is set then precede with an escape 
         character as in "[\-]". To include a literal "[" or "]" or "^" in a set then 
         make them the endpoint of a range, a collating element, or precede with an 
         escape character if the flag regex_constants::escape_in_lists is set.
      </P>
      <H3>Line anchors
      </H3>
      <P>An anchor is something that matches the null string at the start or end of a 
         line: "^" matches the null string at the start of a line, "$" matches the null 
         string at the end of a line.
      </P>
      <H3>Back references
      </H3>
      <P>A back reference is a reference to a previous sub-expression that has already 
         been matched, the reference is to what the sub-expression matched, not to the 
         expression itself. A back reference consists of the escape character "\" 
         followed by a digit "1" to "9", "\1" refers to the first sub-expression, "\2" 
         to the second etc. For example the expression "(.*)\1" matches any string that 
         is repeated about its mid-point for example "abcabc" or "xyzxyz". A back 
         reference to a sub-expression that did not participate in any match, matches 
         the null string: NB this is different to some other regular expression 
         matchers. Back references are only available if the expression is compiled with 
         the flag regex_constants::bk_refs set.
      </P>
      <H3>Characters by code
      </H3>
      <P>This is an extension to the algorithm that is not available in other libraries, 
         it consists of the escape character followed by the digit "0" followed by the 
         octal character code. For example "\023" represents the character whose octal 
         code is 23. Where ambiguity could occur use parentheses to break the expression 
         up: "\0103" represents the character whose code is 103, "(\010)3 represents the 
         character 10 followed by "3". To match characters by their hexadecimal code, 
         use \x followed by a string of hexadecimal digits, optionally enclosed inside 
         {}, for example \xf0 or \x{aff}, notice the latter example is a Unicode 
         character.</P>
      <H3>Word operators
      </H3>
      <P>The following operators are provided for compatibility with the GNU regular 
         expression library.
      </P>
      <P>"\w" matches any single character that is a member of the "word" character 
         class, this is identical to the expression "[[:word:]]".
      </P>
      <P>"\W" matches any single character that is not a member of the "word" character 
         class, this is identical to the expression "[^[:word:]]".
      </P>
      <P>"\&lt;" matches the null string at the start of a word.
      </P>
      <P>"\&gt;" matches the null string at the end of the word.
      </P>

      <P>The escape character "\" has several meanings.
      </P>
      <P>Inside a set declaration the escape character is a normal character unless the

      </P>
      <P>The escape operator may introduce an operator for example: back references, or 
         a word operator.
      </P>
      <P>The escape operator may make the following character normal, for example "\*" 
         represents a literal "*" rather than the repeat operator.

      <P>
         When the expression is compiled as a Perl-compatible regex then the matching 
         algorithms will perform a depth first search on the state machine and report 
         the first match found.</P>
      <P>
         When the expression is compiled as a POSIX-compatible regex then the matching 
         algorithms will match the first possible matching string, if more than one 
         string starting at a given location can match then it matches the longest 
         possible string, unless the flag match_any is set, in which case the first 
         match encountered is returned. Use of the match_any option can reduce the time 
         taken to find the match - but is only useful if the user is less concerned 
         about what matched - for example it would not be suitable for search and 
         replace operations. In cases where their are multiple possible matches all 
         starting at the same location, and all of the same length, then the match 
         chosen is the one with the longest first sub-expression, if that is the same 
         for two or more matches, then the second sub-expression will be examined and so 
         on.

      <P>These differences between Perl matching rules, and POSIX matching rules, mean 
         that these two regular expression syntaxes differ not only in the features 
         offered, but also in the form that the state machine takes and/or the 
         algorithms used to traverse the state machine.</P>
