<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Like any other C++ program which performs I/O operations, there is no 
guarantee that a program using the Filesystem Library will be portable between 
operating systems. Critical aspects of I/O, such as how the operating system 
interprets paths, are unspecified by the C and C++ Standards.</p>
<p>It is not possible to know  if a file or directory name will be 
valid (and thus portable) for an unknown operating system. There is always the possibility that an operating system could use 
names which are unusual (numbers less than 4096, for example) or very 
limited in size (maximum of six character names, for example). In other words, 
portability is never absolute; it is always relative to specific operating or 
file systems.</p>
<p>It is possible to know in advance if a directory or file name is likely to be valid for a particular 
operating system.&nbsp;It is also possible to construct names which are 
likely to be portable to a large number of modern and legacy operating systems.</p>

<p>Almost all modern operating systems support multiple file systems. At the 
minimum, they support a native file system plus a CD-ROM file system (Generally 
ISO-9669, often with Juliet extensions).</p>

<p>Each file system 
may have its own naming rules. For example, modern versions of Windows support NTFS, FAT, FAT32, and ISO-9660 file systems, among others, and the naming rules 
for some of those file systems differ a great deal. Each file system may have 
differing rules for overall path validity, such as a maximum length or number of 
sub-directories.</p>

<p>As a result, the Boost Filesystem Library's <i>name_check</i> mechanism 
cannot guarantee directory and file name portability. Rather, it is intended to 
give the programmer a &quot;fighting chance&quot; to achieve portability by early 
detection of common naming problems.</p>

<h2><a name="name_check­_functions">name_check functions</a></h2>

<p>A <i><a href="path.htm#name_check_typedef">name_check</a></i> function 
returns true if its argument is a valid name for a particular operating or file 
system. A number of these functions are supplied, and user-supplied <i>
name_check</i> functions are also allowed.</p>

<p>The <a href="#portable_name">portable_name</a> function is of particular 
interest because it is the initial <a href="path.htm#name_check­_mechanism">
default name_check function</a> and is carefully chosen to provide wide 
portability yet without severe restrictions on expressiveness.</p>

<p>The <a href="#native">native</a> function is of particular interest because 
it is often used when the source of the path is operator input or other sources 
which are formatted according to operating system rules.</p>
