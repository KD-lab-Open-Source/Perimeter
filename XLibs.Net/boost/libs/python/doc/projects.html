    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This is a partial list of projects using Boost.Python. If you are
    using Boost.Python as your Python/C++ binding solution, we'd be proud to
    list your project on this page. Just <a href=
    "mailto:c++-sig@python.org">post</a> a short description of your project
    and how Boost.Python helps you get the job done, and we'll add it to this
    page .</p>

      <dd>Neuralab is a data analysis environment specifically tailored for
      neural data from <a href="http://www.neuralynx.com">Neuralynx</a>
      acquisition systems. Neuralab combines presentation quality graphics, a
      numerical analysis library, and the <a href=
      "http://www.python.org">Python</a> scripting engine in a single
      application. With Neuralab, Neuralynx users can perform common analysis
      tasks with just a few mouse clicks. More advanced users can create
      custom Python scripts, which can optionally be assigned to menus and
      mouse clicks.</dd>

      <dd>
        Fortress Investment Group has contracted <a href=
        "http://www.boost-consulting.com">Boost Consulting</a> to develop
        core internal financial analysis tools in C++ and to prepare Python
        bindings for them using Boost.Python.

        <blockquote>
          We have a large C++ analytical library specialized for research in
          finance and economics, built for speed and mission critical
          stability. Yet Python offers us the flexibility to test out new
          ideas quickly and increase the productivity of our time versus
          working in C++. There are several key features which make Python
          stand out. Its elegance, stability, and breadth of resources on the
          web are all valuable, but the most important is its extensibility,
          due to its open source transparency. Boost.Python makes Python
          extensibility extremely simple and straightforward, yet preserves a
          great deal of power and control.

          to perform one off tasks without having to go through the full

        decided to base its scripting on python, using boost as the layer
        between the class hierarchy in python and the class hierarchy in C++.

        native python classes when designing missions or writing AI's.</p>

      <dd>
        Computational Crystallography is concerned with the derivation of
        atomic models of crystal structures, given experimental X-ray
        diffraction data. The cctbx is an open-source library of fundamental
        algorithms for crystallographic computations. The core algorithms are
        implemented in C++ and accessed through higher-level Python
        interfaces. 

        <p>The cctbx grew together with Boost.Python and is designed from the
        ground up as a hybrid Python/C++ system. With one minor exception,
        run-time polymorphism is completely handled by Python. C++
        compile-time polymorphism is used to implement performance critical
        algorithms. The Python and C++ layers are seamlessly integrated using
        Boost.Python.</p>

        <p>The SourceForge cctbx project is organized in modules to
        facilitate use in non-crystallographic applications. The scitbx
        module implements a general purpose array family for scientific
        applications and pure C++ ports of FFTPACK and the LBFGS conjugate
        gradient minimizer.</p>

      <dd>
        Rational Discovery provides computational modeling, combinatorial
        library design and custom software development services to the
        pharmaceutical, biotech and chemical industries. We do a substantial
        amount of internal research to develop new approaches for applying
        machine-learning techniques to solve chemical problems. Because we're
        a small organization and chemistry is a large and complex field, it
        is essential that we be able to quickly and easily prototype and test
        new algorithms. 

        <p>For our internal software, we implement core data structures in C
        and expose them to Python using Boost.Python. Algorithm development
        is done in Python and then translated to C if required (often it's
        not). This hybrid development approach not only greatly increases our
        productivity, but it also allows "non-developers" (people without C
        experience) to take part in method development. Learning C is a
        daunting task, but "Python fits your brain." (Thanks to Bruce Eckel
        for the quote.)</p>
