To get started with the Boost Python Library, use the examples
getting_started1.cpp and getting_started2.cpp.

    bjam -sTOOLS=your-toolset test

in this directory will build and run the examples.

Other configuration variables may need to be set as described in
http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/building.html.  These can be
supplied by the environment, on the command-line with

  -sVARIABLENAME=value

or in the local Jamrules file.

If you move this example from its place in the Boost development tree
you'll need to edit at least one line in Jamrules and one line in
boost-build.jam.
