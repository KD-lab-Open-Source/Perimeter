<h2><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>The definitions are given in terms of the <a href=
        "bibliography.html#ISO-98">C++ Standard</a>. References to the standard
  are in the form [1.2.3/4], which represents the section number, with the paragraph
  number following the &quot;/&quot;.</p>
<p>Because the definitions are written in something akin to &quot;standardese&quot;,
  they can be difficult to understand. The intent isn&#39;t to confuse, but rather
  to clarify the additional requirements Boost.Threads places on a C++ implementation
  as defined by the C++ Standard.</p>
<h2><a name="definitions"></a>Definitions</h2>
<h3><a name="definition-thread"></a>Thread</h3>
<p>Thread is short for &quot;thread of execution&quot;. A thread of execution
  is an execution environment [1.9/7] within the execution environment of a C++
  program [1.9]. The main() function [3.6.1] of the program is the initial function
  of the initial thread. A program in a multithreading environment always has
  an initial thread even if the program explicitly creates no additional threads.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, each thread shares all aspects of its execution
  environment with other threads in the program. Shared aspects of the execution
  environment include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Static storage duration (static, extern) objects [3.7.1].</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Dynamic storage duration (heap) objects [3.7.3]. Thus each memory allocation
    will return a unique addresses, regardless of the thread making the allocation
    request.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Automatic storage duration (stack) objects [3.7.2] accessed via pointer
    or reference from another thread.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Resources provided by the operating system. For example, files.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The program itself. In other words, each thread is executing some function
    of the same program, not a totally different program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each thread has its own:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Registers and current execution sequence (program counter) [1.9/5].</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Automatic storage duration (stack) objects [3.7.2].</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="definition-thread-safe"></a>Thread-safe</h3>
<p>A program is thread-safe if it has no <a href="#Race condition">race conditions</a>,
  does not <a href="#Deadlock">deadlock</a>, and has no <a href="#Priority failure">priority
  failures</a>.</p>
<p>Note that thread-safety does not necessarily imply efficiency, and than while
  some thread-safety violations can be determined statically at compile time,
  many thread-safety errors can only only be detected at runtime.</p>
<h3><a name="definition-thread-state"></a>Thread State</h3>
<p>During the lifetime of a thread, it shall be in one of the following states:</p>
<table summary="thread states" border="1" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td><b>State</b></td>
    <td><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ready</td>
    <td>Ready to run, but waiting for a processor.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Running</td>
    <td>Currently executing on a processor. Zero or more threads may be running
      at any time, with a maximum equal to the number of processors.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Blocked</td>
    <td>Waiting for some resource other than a processor which is not currently
      available, or for the completion of calls to library functions [1.9/6].
      The term &quot;waiting&quot; is synonymous for &quot;blocked&quot;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Terminated</td>
    <td>Finished execution but not yet detached or joined.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Thread state transitions shall occur only as specified:</p>
<table summary="state transitions" border="1" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td><b>From</b></td>
    <td><b>To</b></td>
    <td><b>Cause</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p align="left">[none]</p>
    </td>
    <td>Ready</td>
    <td>Thread is created by a call to a library function. In the case of the
      initial thread, creation is implicit and occurs during the startup of the
      main() function [3.6.1].</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ready</td>
    <td>Running</td>
    <td>Processor becomes available.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Running</td>
    <td>Ready</td>
    <td>Thread preempted.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Running</td>
    <td>Blocked</td>
    <td>Thread calls a library function which waits for a resource or for the
      completion of I/O.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Running</td>
    <td>Terminated</td>
    <td>Thread returns from its initial function, calls a thread termination library
      function, or is canceled by some other thread calling a thread termination
      library function.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Blocked</td>
    <td>Ready</td>
    <td>The resource being waited for becomes available, or the blocking library
      function completes.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Terminated</td>
    <td>[none]</td>
    <td>Thread is detached or joined by some other thread calling the appropriate
      library function, or by program termination [3.6.3].</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>[Note: if a suspend() function is added to the threading library, additional
  transitions to the blocked state will have to be added to the above table.]</p>
<h3><a name="definition-race-condition"></a>Race Condition</h3>
<p>A race condition is what occurs when multiple threads read and write to the
  same memory without proper synchronization, resulting in an incorrect value
  being read or written. The result of a race condition may be a bit pattern which
  isn&#39;t even a valid value for the data type. A race condition results in
  undefined behavior [1.3.12].</p>
<p>Race conditions can be prevented by serializing memory access using the tools
  provided by Boost.Threads.</p>
<h3><a name="definition-deadlock"></a>Deadlock</h3>
<p>Deadlock is an execution state where for some set of threads, each thread in
  the set is blocked waiting for some action by one of the other threads in the
  set. Since each is waiting on the others, none will ever become ready again.</p>
<h3><a name="definition-starvation"></a>Starvation</h3>
<p>The condition in which a thread is not making sufficient progress in its work
  during a given time interval.</p>
<h3><a name="definition-priority-failure"></a>Priority Failure</h3>
<p>A priority failure (such as priority inversion or infinite overtaking) occurs
  when threads executed in such a sequence that required work is not performed
  in time to be useful.</p>
<h3><a name="definition-visibility"></a>Memory Visibility</h3>
<p>An address [1.7] shall always point to the same memory byte, regardless of
  the thread or processor dereferencing the address.</p>
<p>An object [1.8, 1.9] is accessible from multiple threads if it is of static
  storage duration (static, extern) [3.7.1], or if a pointer or reference to it
  is explicitly or implicitly dereferenced in multiple threads.</p>
<p>For an object accessible from multiple threads, the value of the object accessed
  from one thread may be indeterminate or different than the value accessed from
  another thread, except under the conditions specified in the following table.
  For the same row of the table, the value of an object accessible at the indicated
  sequence point in thread A will be determinate and the same if accessed at or
  after the indicated sequence point in thread B, provided the object is not otherwise
  modified. In the table, the &quot;sequence point at a call&quot; is the sequence
  point after the evaluation of all function arguments [1.9/17], while the &quot;sequence
  point after a call&quot; is the sequence point after the copying of the returned
  value...&quot; [1.9/17].</p>
<table summary="memory visibility" border="1" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><b>Thread A</b></td>
    <td align="center"><b>Thread B</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The sequence point at a call to a library thread-creation function.</td>
    <td>The first sequence point of the initial function in the new thread created
      by the Thread A call.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The sequence point at a call to a library function which locks a mutex,
      directly or by waiting for a condition variable.</td>
    <td>The sequence point after a call to a library function which unlocks the
      same mutex.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The last sequence point before thread termination.</td>
    <td>The sequence point after a call to a library function which joins the
      terminated thread.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The sequence point at a call to a library function which signals or broadcasts
      a condition variable.</td>
    <td>The sequence point after the call to the library function which was waiting
      on that same condition variable or signal.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The architecture of the execution environment and the observable behavior of
  the abstract machine [1.9] shall be the same on all processors.</p>
<p>The latitude granted by the C++ standard for an implementation to alter the
  definition of observable behavior of the abstract machine to include additional
  library I/O functions [1.9/6] is extended to include threading library functions.</p>
<p>When an exception is thrown and there is no matching exception handler in the
  same thread, behavior is undefined. The preferred behavior is the same as when
  there is no matching exception handler in a program [15.3/9]. That is, terminate()
  is called, and it is implementation defined whether or not the stack is unwound.</p>
