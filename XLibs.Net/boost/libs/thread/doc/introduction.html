<h2><a name="motivation"></a>Motivation</h2>
<p>With client/server and three-tier architectures becoming common place in today&#39;s
  world, it&#39;s becoming increasingly important for programs to be able to handle
  parallel processing. Modern day operating systems usually provide some support
  for this through native thread APIs. Unfortunately, writing portable code that
  makes use of parallel processing in C++ is made very difficult by a lack of
  a standard interface for these native APIs. Further, these APIs are almost universally
  C APIs and fail to take advantage of C++&#39;s strengths, or to address C++&#39;s
  issues.</p>
<p>The <b>Boost.Threads</b> library is an attempt to define a portable interface
  for writing parallel processes in C++.</p>
<h2><a name="goals"></a>Goals</h2>
<p>The <b>Boost.Threads</b> library has several goals that should help to set
  it apart from other solutions. These goals are listed in order of precedence
  with full descriptions below.</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Portability</b>
    <p><b>Boost.Threads</b> was designed to be highly portable. The goal is for
      the interface to be easily implemented on any platform that supports threads,
      and possibly even on platforms without native thread support.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Safety</b>
    <p><b>Boost.Threads</b> was designed to be as safe as possible. Writing <a href="definitions.html#Thread-safe">thread-safe</a>
      code is very difficult and successful libraries must strive to insulate
      the programmer from dangerous constructs as much as possible. This is accomplished
      in several ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p align="left">C++ language features are used make correct usage easy
          (if possible, the default) and error-prone impossible or at least more
          difficult. For example, see the <a href="mutex_concept.html">Mutex</a>
          and <a href="lock_concept.html">Lock</a> designs, and how note how they
          interact.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Certain traditional concurrent programming features are
          considered so error-prone that they are not provided at all. For example,
          see the <a
                        href="rationale.html#Events">Events Not Provided</a> rationale.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Dangerous features, or features which may be misused,
          are identified as such in the documentation to make users aware of potential
          pitfalls.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Flexibility</b>
    <p><b>Boost.Threads</b> was designed to be flexible. This goal is often at
      odds with <i>safety</i>. When functionality might be compromised by the
      desire to keep the interface safe, <b> Boost.Threads</b> has been designed
      to provide the functionality, but to make it&#39;s use prohibitive for general
      use. In other words, the interfaces have been designed such that it's usually
      obvious when something is unsafe, and the documentation is written to explain
      why.</p>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Efficiency</b>
    <p><b>Boost.Threads</b> was designed to be as efficient as possible. When
      building a library on top of another library there is always a danger that
      the result will be so much slower than the &quot;native&quot; API that programmers
      are inclined to ignore the higher level API. <b>Boost.Threads</b> was designed
      to minimize the chances of this occurring. The interfaces have been crafted
      to allow an implementation the greatest chance of being as efficient as
      possible. This goal is often at odds with the goal for <i>safety</i>. Every
      effort was made to ensure efficient implementations, but when in conflict
      <i>safety</i> has always taken precedence.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="phases"></a>Iterative Phases</h2>
<p>Another goal of <b>Boost.Threads</b> was to take a dynamic, iterative approach
  in its development. The computing industry is still exploring the concepts of
  parallel programming. Most thread libraries supply only simple primitive concepts
  for thread synchronization. These concepts are very simple, but they are very
  difficult to use safely or to provide formal proofs for constructs built on
  top of them. There has been a lot of research in other concepts, such as in
  &quot;Communicating Sequential Processes.&quot; <b>Boost.Threads</b> was designed
  in iterative steps, providing the building blocks necessary for the next step,
  and giving the researcher the tools necessary to explore new concepts in a portable
  manner.</p>
<p>Given the goal of following a dynamic, iterative approach <b> Boost.Threads</b>
  shall go through several growth cycles. Each phase in its development shall
  be roughly documented here.</p>
<h3><a name="phase1"></a>Phase 1, Synchronization Primitives</h3>
<p>Boost is all about providing high quality libraries with implementations for
  many platforms. Unfortunately, there&#39;s a big problem faced by developers
  wishing to supply such high quality libraries, namely thread-safety. The C++
  standard doesn&#39;t address threads at all, but real world programs often make
  use of native threading support. A portable library that doesn&#39;t address
  the issue of thread-safety is there for not much help to a programmer who wants
  to use the library in his multithreaded application. So there&#39;s a very great
  need for portable primitives that will allow the library developer to create
  <a href="definitions.html#Thread-safe"> thread-safe</a> implementations. This
  need far out weighs the need for portable methods to create and manage threads.</p>
<p>Because of this need, the first phase of <b>Boost.Threads</b> focuses solely
  on providing portable primitive concepts for thread synchronization. Types provided
  in this phase include the <a href="mutex.html"> mutex/try_mutex/timed_mutex</a>,
  <a href="recursive_mutex.html"> recursive_mutex/recursive_try_mutex/recursive_timed_mutex</a>
  and <a href="exceptions.html#class-lock_error">lock_error</a>. These are considered
  the &quot;core&quot; synchronization primitives, though there are others that
  will be added in later phases.</p>
<h3><a name="phase2"></a>Phase 2, Thread Management and Thread Specific Storage</h3>
<p>This phase addresses the creation and management of threads and provides a
  mechanism for thread specific storage (data associated with a thread instance).
  Thread management is a tricky issue in C++, so this phase addresses only the
  basic needs of multithreaded program. Later phases are likely to add additional
  functionality in this area. This phase of <b>Boost.Threads</b> adds the <a href="thread.html">thread</a>
  and <a href="tss.html#class-thread_specific_ptr">thread_specific_ptr</a> types.
  With these additions the <b>Boost.Threads</b> library can be considered minimal
  but complete.</p>
<h3><a name="next-phase"></a>The Next Phase</h3>
<p>The next phase will address more advanced synchronization concepts, such as
  read/write mutexes and barriers.</p>
