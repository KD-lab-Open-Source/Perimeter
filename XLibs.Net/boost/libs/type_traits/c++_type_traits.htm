<p>Generic programming (writing code which works with any data
type meeting a set of requirements) has become the method of
choice for providing reusable code. However, there are times in
generic programming when &quot;generic&quot; just isn't good
enough - sometimes the differences between types are too large
for an efficient generic implementation. This is when the traits
technique becomes important - by encapsulating those properties
that need to be considered on a type by type basis inside a
traits class, we can minimise the amount of code that has to
differ from one type to another, and maximise the amount of
generic code.</p>

<p>Consider an example: when working with character strings, one
common operation is to determine the length of a null terminated
string. Clearly it's possible to write generic code that can do
this, but it turns out that there are much more efficient methods
available: for example, the C library functions <font size="2"
face="Courier New">strlen</font> and <font size="2"
face="Courier New">wcslen</font> are usually written in assembler,
and with suitable hardware support can be considerably faster
than a generic version written in C++. The authors of the C++
standard library realised this, and abstracted the properties of <font
size="2" face="Courier New">char</font> and <font size="2"
face="Courier New">wchar_t</font> into the class <font size="2"
face="Courier New">char_traits</font>. Generic code that works
with character strings can simply use <font size="2"
face="Courier New">char_traits&lt;&gt;::length</font> to
determine the length of a null terminated string, safe in the
knowledge that specialisations of <font size="2"
face="Courier New">char_traits</font> will use the most
appropriate method available to them.</p>

<h4>Type traits</h4>

<p>Class <font size="2" face="Courier New">char_traits</font> is
a classic example of a collection of type specific properties
wrapped up in a single class - what Nathan Myers termed a <i>baggage
class</i>[1]. In the Boost type-traits library, we[2] have
written a set of very specific traits classes, each of which
encapsulate a single trait from the C++ type system; for example,
is a type a pointer or a reference type? Or does a type have a
trivial constructor, or a const-qualifier? The type-traits
classes share a unified design: each class has a single member <i>value</i>,
a compile-time constant that is true if the type has the
specified property, and false otherwise. As we will show, these
classes can be used in generic programming to determine the
properties of a given type and introduce optimisations that are
appropriate for that case.</p>

<p>The type-traits library also contains a set of classes that
perform a specific transformation on a type; for example, they
can remove a top-level const or volatile qualifier from a type.
Each class that performs a transformation defines a single
typedef-member <i>type</i> that is the result of the
transformation. All of the type-traits classes are defined inside
namespace <font size="2" face="Courier New">boost</font>; for
brevity, namespace-qualification is omitted in most of the code
samples given.</p>

<h4>Implementation</h4>

<p>There are far too many separate classes contained in the type-traits
library to give a full implementation here - see the source code
in the Boost library for the full details - however, most of the
implementation is fairly repetitive anyway, so here we will just
give you a flavour for how some of the classes are implemented.
Beginning with possibly the simplest class in the library, is_void&lt;T&gt;
has a member <i>value</i> that is true only if T is void.</p>

<pre>template &lt;typename T&gt; 
struct is_void
{ static const bool value = false; };

template &lt;&gt; 
struct is_void&lt;void&gt;
{ static const bool value = true; };</pre>

<p>Here we define a primary version of the template class <font
size="2" face="Courier New">is_void</font>, and provide a full-specialisation
when T is void. While full specialisation of a template class is
an important technique, sometimes we need a solution that is
halfway between a fully generic solution, and a full
specialisation. This is exactly the situation for which the
standards committee defined partial template-class specialisation.
As an example, consider the class boost::is_pointer&lt;T&gt;:
here we needed a primary version that handles all the cases where
T is not a pointer, and a partial specialisation to handle all
the cases where T is a pointer:</p>

<pre>template &lt;typename T&gt; 
struct is_pointer 
{ static const bool value = false; };

template &lt;typename T&gt; 
struct is_pointer&lt;T*&gt; 
{ static const bool value = true; };</pre>

<p>The syntax for partial specialisation is somewhat arcane and
could easily occupy an article in its own right; like full
specialisation, in order to write a partial specialisation for a
class, you must first declare the primary template. The partial
specialisation contains an extra &lt;&#133;&gt; after the class
name that contains the partial specialisation parameters; these
define the types that will bind to that partial specialisation
rather than the default template. The rules for what can appear
in a partial specialisation are somewhat convoluted, but as a
rule of thumb if you can legally write two function overloads of
the form:</p>

<pre>void foo(T);
void foo(U);</pre>

<p>Then you can also write a partial specialisation of the form:</p>

<pre>template &lt;typename T&gt;
class c{ /*details*/ };

template &lt;typename T&gt;

class c&lt;U&gt;{ /*details*/ };</pre>

<p>This rule is by no means foolproof, but it is reasonably
simple to remember and close enough to the actual rule to be
useful for everyday use.</p>

<p>As a more complex example of partial specialisation consider
the class remove_bounds&lt;T&gt;. This class defines a single
typedef-member <i>type</i> that is the same type as T but with
any top-level array bounds removed; this is an example of a
traits class that performs a transformation on a type:</p>

<pre>template &lt;typename T&gt; 
struct remove_bounds
{ typedef T type; };

template &lt;typename T, std::size_t N&gt; 
struct remove_bounds&lt;T[N]&gt;
{ typedef T type; };</pre>

<p>The aim of remove_bounds is this: imagine a generic algorithm
that is passed an array type as a template parameter, <font
size="2" face="Courier New">remove_bounds</font> provides a means
of determining the underlying type of the array. For example <code>remove_bounds&lt;int[4][5]&gt;::type</code>
would evaluate to the type <code>int[5]</code>. This example also
shows that the number of template parameters in a partial
specialisation does not have to match the number in the default
template. However, the number of parameters that appear after the
class name do have to match the number and type of the parameters
in the default template.</p>

<h4>Optimised copy</h4>

<p>As an example of how the type traits classes can be used,
consider the standard library algorithm copy:</p>

<pre>template&lt;typename Iter1, typename Iter2&gt;
Iter2 copy(Iter1 first, Iter1 last, Iter2 out);</pre>

<p>Obviously, there's no problem writing a generic version of
copy that works for all iterator types Iter1 and Iter2; however,
there are some circumstances when the copy operation can best be
performed by a call to <font size="2" face="Courier New">memcpy</font>.
In order to implement copy in terms of <font size="2"
face="Courier New">memcpy</font> all of the following conditions
need to be met:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Both of the iterator types Iter1 and Iter2 must be
        pointers.</li>
    <li>Both Iter1 and Iter2 must point to the same type -
        excluding <font size="2" face="Courier New">const</font>
        and <font size="2" face="Courier New">volatile</font>-qualifiers.</li>
    <li>The type pointed to by Iter1 must have a trivial
        assignment operator.</li>
</ul>

<p>By trivial assignment operator we mean that the type is either
a scalar type[3] or:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The type has no user defined assignment operator.</li>
    <li>The type does not have any data members that are
        references.</li>
    <li>All base classes, and all data member objects must have
        trivial assignment operators.</li>
</ul>

<p>If all these conditions are met then a type can be copied
using <font size="2" face="Courier New">memcpy</font> rather than
using a compiler generated assignment operator. The type-traits
library provides a class <i>has_trivial_assign</i>, such that <code>has_trivial_assign&lt;T&gt;::value</code>
is true only if T has a trivial assignment operator. This class
&quot;just works&quot; for scalar types, but has to be explicitly
specialised for class/struct types that also happen to have a
trivial assignment operator. In other words if <i>has_trivial_assign</i>
gives the wrong answer, it will give the &quot;safe&quot; wrong
answer - that trivial assignment is not allowable.</p>

<p>The code for an optimised version of copy that uses <font
size="2" face="Courier New">memcpy</font> where appropriate is
given in listing 1. The code begins by defining a template class <i>copier</i>,
that takes a single Boolean template parameter, and has a static
template member function <font size="2" face="Courier New">do_copy</font>
which performs the generic version of <font size="2">copy</font>
(in other words the &quot;slow but safe version&quot;). Following
that there is a specialisation for <i>copier&lt;true&gt;</i>:
again this defines a static template member function <font
size="2" face="Courier New">do_copy</font>, but this version uses
memcpy to perform an &quot;optimised&quot; copy.</p>

<p>In order to complete the implementation, what we need now is a
version of copy, that calls <code>copier&lt;true&gt;::do_copy</code>
if it is safe to use <font size="2" face="Courier New">memcpy</font>,
and otherwise calls <code>copier&lt;false&gt;::do_copy</code> to
do a &quot;generic&quot; copy. This is what the version in
listing 1 does. To understand how the code works look at the code
for <font size="2" face="Courier New">copy</font> and consider
first the two typedefs <i>v1_t</i> and <i>v2_t</i>. These use <code>std::iterator_traits&lt;Iter1&gt;::value_type</code>
to determine what type the two iterators point to, and then feed
the result into another type-traits class <i>remove_cv</i> that
removes the top-level const-volatile-qualifiers: this will allow
copy to compare the two types without regard to const- or
volatile-qualifiers. Next, <font size="2" face="Courier New">copy</font>
declares an enumerated value <i>can_opt</i> that will become the
template parameter to copier - declaring this here as a constant
is really just a convenience - the value could be passed directly
to class <font size="2" face="Courier New">copier</font>. The
value of <i>can_opt</i> is computed by verifying that all of the
following are true:</p>

<ul>
    <li>first that the two iterators point to the same type by
        using a type-traits class <i>is_same</i>.</li>
    <li>Then that both iterators are real pointers - using the
        class <i>is_pointer</i> described above.</li>
    <li>Finally that the pointed-to types have a trivial
        assignment operator using <i>has_trivial_assign</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally we can use the value of <i>can_opt</i> as the template
argument to copier - this version of copy will now adapt to
whatever parameters are passed to it, if its possible to use <font
size="2" face="Courier New">memcpy</font>, then it will do so,
otherwise it will use a generic copy.</p>

<h4>Was it worth it?</h4>

<p>It has often been repeated in these columns that &quot;premature
optimisation is the root of all evil&quot; [4]. So the question
must be asked: was our optimisation premature? To put this in
perspective the timings for our version of copy compared a
conventional generic copy[5] are shown in table 1.</p>

<p>Clearly the optimisation makes a difference in this case; but,
to be fair, the timings are loaded to exclude cache miss effects
- without this accurate comparison between algorithms becomes
difficult. However, perhaps we can add a couple of caveats to the
premature optimisation rule:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you use the right algorithm for the job in the first
        place then optimisation will not be required; in some
        cases, <font size="2" face="Courier New">memcpy</font> is
        the right algorithm.</li>
    <li>If a component is going to be reused in many places by
        many people then optimisations may well be worthwhile
        where they would not be so for a single case - in other
        words, the likelihood that the optimisation will be
        absolutely necessary somewhere, sometime is that much
        higher. Just as importantly the perceived value of the
        stock implementation will be higher: there is no point
        standardising an algorithm if users reject it on the
        grounds that there are better, more heavily optimised
        versions available.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pair of References</h4>

<p>The optimised copy example shows how type traits may be used
to perform optimisation decisions at compile-time. Another
important usage of type traits is to allow code to compile that
otherwise would not do so unless excessive partial specialization
is used. This is possible by delegating partial specialization to
the type traits classes. Our example for this form of usage is a
pair that can hold references [6].</p>

<p>First, let us examine the definition of &quot;std::pair&quot;,
omitting the comparision operators, default constructor, and
template copy constructor for simplicity:</p>

<pre>template &lt;typename T1, typename T2&gt; 
struct pair 
{
  typedef T1 first_type;
  typedef T2 second_type;

  T1 first;
  T2 second;

  pair(const T1 &amp; nfirst, const T2 &amp; nsecond)
  :first(nfirst), second(nsecond) { }
};</pre>

<p>Now, this &quot;pair&quot; cannot hold references as it
currently stands, because the constructor would require taking a
reference to a reference, which is currently illegal [7]. Let us
consider what the constructor's parameters would have to be in
order to allow &quot;pair&quot; to hold non-reference types,
references, and constant references:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="638">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="50%">Type of &quot;T1&quot;</td>
        <td valign="top" width="50%">Type of parameter to
        initializing constructor</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="50%"><pre>T</pre>
        </td>
        <td valign="top" width="50%"><pre>const T &amp;</pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="50%"><pre>T &amp;</pre>
        </td>
        <td valign="top" width="50%"><pre>T &amp;</pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="50%"><pre>const T &amp;</pre>
        </td>
        <td valign="top" width="50%"><pre>const T &amp;</pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>A little familiarity with the type traits classes allows us to
construct a single mapping that allows us to determine the type
of parameter from the type of the contained class. The type
traits classes provide a transformation &quot;add_reference&quot;,
which adds a reference to its type, unless it is already a
reference.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="580">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="21%">Type of &quot;T1&quot;</td>
        <td valign="top" width="27%">Type of &quot;const T1&quot;</td>
        <td valign="top" width="53%">Type of &quot;add_reference&lt;const
        T1&gt;::type&quot;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="21%"><pre>T</pre>
        </td>
        <td valign="top" width="27%"><pre>const T</pre>
        </td>
        <td valign="top" width="53%"><pre>const T &amp;</pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="21%"><pre>T &amp;</pre>
        </td>
        <td valign="top" width="27%"><pre>T &amp; [8]</pre>
        </td>
        <td valign="top" width="53%"><pre>T &amp;</pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="21%"><pre>const T &amp;</pre>
        </td>
        <td valign="top" width="27%"><pre>const T &amp;</pre>
        </td>
        <td valign="top" width="53%"><pre>const T &amp;</pre>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>This allows us to build a primary template definition for
&quot;pair&quot; that can contain non-reference types, reference
types, and constant reference types:</p>

<pre>template &lt;typename T1, typename T2&gt; 
struct pair 
{
  typedef T1 first_type;
  typedef T2 second_type;

  T1 first;
  T2 second;

  pair(boost::add_reference&lt;const T1&gt;::type nfirst,
       boost::add_reference&lt;const T2&gt;::type nsecond)
  :first(nfirst), second(nsecond) { }
};</pre>

<p>Add back in the standard comparision operators, default
constructor, and template copy constructor (which are all the
same), and you have a std::pair that can hold reference types!</p>

<p>This same extension <i>could</i> have been done using partial
template specialization of &quot;pair&quot;, but to specialize
&quot;pair&quot; in this way would require three partial
specializations, plus the primary template. Type traits allows us
to define a single primary template that adjusts itself auto-magically
to any of these partial specializations, instead of a brute-force
partial specialization approach. Using type traits in this
fashion allows programmers to delegate partial specialization to
the type traits classes, resulting in code that is easier to
maintain and easier to understand.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>We hope that in this article we have been able to give you
some idea of what type-traits are all about. A more complete
listing of the available classes are in the boost documentation,
along with further examples using type traits. Templates have
enabled C++ uses to take the advantage of the code reuse that
generic programming brings; hopefully this article has shown that
generic programming does not have to sink to the lowest common
denominator, and that templates can be optimal as well as generic.</p>
