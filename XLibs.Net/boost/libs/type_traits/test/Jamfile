# There are two ways to invoke this Jamfile:
#
# If we pass the argument --type-traits-unit-test
# to bjam, then the tests are built as one big test
# program: this may be slightly quicker in some cases,
# but causes problems if any of the test sources don't compile.
#
# Alternatively, the default behaviour is to build each source
# file as a separate test program, these no longer depend upon Boost.Test
# (which causes cyclic dependencies).  We also get a separate status report
# for each trait, which makes it easier to track down issues with non-conforming
# compilers.
