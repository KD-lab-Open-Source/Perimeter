<PRE CLASS="code">template &lt;typename SizeType = std::size_t&gt;
class simple_segregated_storage
{
  ... // Public interface

  protected:
    void * first;
    static void * & nextof(void * const ptr);
    void * find_prev(void * ptr);
};</PRE>

<P>
<H3 CLASS="code">void * first;</H3>

<P>
This data member is the free list.  It points to the first chunk in the free list, or is equal to 0 if the free list is empty.

<P>
<H3 CLASS="code">static void * & nextof(void * const ptr);</H3>

<P>
This is a convenience function.  It helps clean up code dealing with the free list by making it more readable.  The return value is just <SPAN CLASS="code">*ptr</SPAN> cast to the appropriate type.  <SPAN CLASS="code">ptr</SPAN> must not be 0.

<P>
As an example, let us assume that we want to truncate the free list after the first chunk.  That is, we want to set <SPAN CLASS="code">*first</SPAN> to 0; this will result in a free list with only one entry.  The normal way to do this is to first cast <SPAN CLASS="code">first</SPAN> to a pointer to a pointer to void, and then dereference and assign (<SPAN CLASS="code">*static_cast&lt;void **&gt;(first) = 0;</SPAN>).  This can be done more easily through the use of this convenience function (<SPAN CLASS="code">nextof(first) = 0;</SPAN>).

<P>
<H3 CLASS="code">void * find_prev(void * ptr);</H3>

<P>
Traverses the free list referred to by <SPAN CLASS="code">first</SPAN>, and returns the pointer previous to where <SPAN CLASS="code">ptr</SPAN> would go if it was in the free list.  Returns 0 if <SPAN CLASS="code">ptr</SPAN> would go at the beginning of the free list (i.e., before <SPAN CLASS="code">first</SPAN>).

<P>
Note that this function finds the location previous to where <SPAN CLASS="code">ptr</SPAN> <STRONG>would</STRONG> go <STRONG>if it was</STRONG> in the free list.  It does <STRONG>not</STRONG> find the entry in the free list before <SPAN CLASS="code">ptr</SPAN> (unless <SPAN CLASS="code">ptr</SPAN> is already in the free list).  Specifically, <SPAN CLASS="code">find_prev(0)</SPAN> will return 0, <STRONG>not</STRONG> the last entry in the free list.
