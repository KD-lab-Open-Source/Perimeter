<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Boost Pool Library</H1>

<P>
<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
<H3>What is Pool?</H3>

<P>
Pool allocation is a memory allocation scheme that is very fast, but limited in its usage.  For more information on pool allocation (also called &quot;simple segregated storage&quot;), see <A HREF="concepts.html">the concepts document</A>.

<P>
<H3>Why should I use Pool?</H3>

<P>
Using Pools gives you more control over how memory is used in your program.  For example, you could have a situation where you want to allocate a bunch of small objects at one point, and then reach a point in your program where none of them are needed any more.  Using pool interfaces, you can choose to run their destructors or just drop them off into oblivion; the pool interface will guarantee that there are no system memory leaks.

<P>
<H3>When should I use Pool?</H3>

<P>
Pools are generally used when there is a lot of allocation and deallocation of small objects.  Another common usage is the situation above, where many objects may be dropped out of memory.

<P>
In general, use Pools when you need a more efficient way to do unusual memory control.

<P>
<H3>How do I use Pool?</H3>

<P>
See the <A HREF="interfaces.html">pool interfaces document</A>, which covers the different Pool interfaces supplied by this library.

<P>
<H2>Library Structure and Dependencies</H2>

<P>
Forward declarations of all the exposed symbols for this library are in the header <SPAN CLASS="code">&lt;boost/pool/poolfwd.hpp&gt;</SPAN>.

<P>
The library may use macros, which will be prefixed with <SPAN CLASS="code">BOOST_POOL_</SPAN>.  The exception to this rule are the include file guards, which (for file <EM>xxx</EM>.hpp) is <SPAN CLASS="code">BOOST_<EM>xxx</EM>_HPP</SPAN>.

<P>
All exposed symbols defined by the library will be in namespace <SPAN CLASS="code">boost</SPAN>.  All symbols used only by the implementation will be in namespace <SPAN CLASS="code">boost::details::pool</SPAN>.

<P>
Every header used only by the implementation is in the subdirectory <SPAN CLASS="code">detail/</SPAN>.

<P>
Any header in the library may include any other header in the library or any system-supplied header at its discretion.

<P>
<H2>Installation</H2>

<P>
The Boost Pool library is a header file library.  That means there is no .lib, .dll, or .so to build; just add the Boost directory to your compiler's include file path, and you should be good to go!

<P>
<H2>Building the Test Programs</H2>

<P>
The subdirectory &quot;build&quot; contains subdirectories for several different platforms.  These subdirectories contain all necessary work-around code for that platform, as well as makefiles or IDE project files as appropriate.

<P>
Read the &quot;readme.txt&quot; in the proper subdirectory, if it exists.

<P>
The standard makefile targets are &quot;all&quot;, &quot;clean&quot; (which deletes any intermediate files), and &quot;veryclean&quot; (which deletes any intermediate files and executables).  All intermediate and executable files are built in the same directory as the makefile/project file.  If there is a project file supplied instead of a makefile, &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;veryclean&quot; shell scripts/batch files will be provided.

<P>
Project files and makefiles for additional platforms may be sent to Stephen Cleary at scleary AT jerviswebb DOT com.

<H2>Future Directions</H2>

<P>
Another pool interface will be written: a base class for per-class pool allocation.
