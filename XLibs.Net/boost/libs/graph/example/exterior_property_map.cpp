  Exterior Decorator Basics

  An exterior decorator is a way of associating properties with the
  vertices or edges of a graph. The "exterior" part means that the
  properties are not stored inside the graph object (see
  internal_decorator_basics.cc). Instead they are stored
  separately, and passed as an extra argument to any
  algorithm they are needed in. There are several standard
  decorator types such a color and weight that are used
  in the GGCL algorithms.

  The main responsibility of a decorator is to provide an operator[]
  that maps a vertex (or vertex ID) to the property value for that
  vertex. It just so happens that a normal array provides this.  In
  addition, a decorator must provide access to the property type
  through the decorator_traits class. For convenience, GGCL
  already defines a decorator_triats class for pointer and
  array types.
