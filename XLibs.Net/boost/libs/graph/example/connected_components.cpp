/*

  This example demonstrates the usage of the connected_components
  algorithm on a undirected graph. The example graphs come from
  "Introduction to Algorithms", Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest p. 87
  (though we number the vertices from zero instead of one).

  Sample output:

  Total number of components: 3
  Vertex 0 is in component 0
  Vertex 1 is in component 0
  Vertex 2 is in component 1
  Vertex 3 is in component 2
  Vertex 4 is in component 0
  Vertex 5 is in component 1
