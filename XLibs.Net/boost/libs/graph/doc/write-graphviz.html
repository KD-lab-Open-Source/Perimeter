<p>
This is to write a BGL graph object into a output stream in graphviz
dot format so that users can make use of <a href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/">AT&amp;T graphviz</a> to draw a
picture with nice layout.
<p>
The first version with two parameters will write graph into an
<tt>std::ostream</tt> where vertex is represented by numerical vertex
IDs. If users have either interior or exterior properties for each vertex
in the graph, the second version above provides a way to print those
properties into the gaphviz format file. For example, if each vertex
in the graph has its label through property map object <tt>name</tt>,
users can use the second version:
<pre>
  write_graph(out, g, make_label_writer(name));
</pre>
The utility function <tt>make_label_writer</tt> returns a predefined
<a href="./write-graphviz.html#concept:PropertyWriter">PropertyWriter</a> for vertex label.  Similarly, the third
version and fourth version require edge <a href="./write-graphviz.html#concept:PropertyWriter">PropertyWriter</a>, edge
<a href="./write-graphviz.html#concept:PropertyWriter">PropertyWriter</a> and graph <a href="./write-graphviz.html#concept:PropertyWriter">PropertyWriter</a>,
respectively.

<h3><A NAME="concept:PropertyWriter">
<tt>PropertyWriter</tt>
</h3>

PropertyWriter is used in the <tt>write_graphviz</tt> function to
print properties of vertex, edge or graph. There are two types of
PropertyWriter. One is for a vertex or edge. The other is for a graph.
Thus, users could easily extend the <tt>write_graphviz</tt> function
by creating their own <a href="./write-graphviz.html#concept:PropertyWriter">PropertyWriter</a> only.
<p>
A <a href="./write-graphviz.html#concept:PropertyWriter">PropertyWriter</a> 
for vertices or edges is a functor which can be called with two parameters:
<tt>std::ostream</tt> and either vertex or edge descriptor. It should output a
pair of brackets with a series of assigments &quot;name=value&quot; inside.
Each assignment should be separated either with space, with comma, or with semicolon.
The following functor, provided by BGL, is the example of PropertyWriter for vertices or
edges.  It is used to print the label of each vertex or edge.
<pre>
  template < class Name >
  class label_writer {
  public:
    label_writer(Name _name) : name(_name) {}
    template <class VertexOrEdge>
    void operator()(std::ostream& out, const VertexOrEdge& v) const {
      out << "[label=\"" << name[v] << "\"]";
    }
  private:
    Name name;
  };
</pre>

<p>
A function to conveniently create this writer is provided:
<pre>
template &lt; class Name &gt;
label_writer&lt;Name&gt;
make_label_writer(Name n);
</pre>

<p>
A <a href="./write-graphviz.html#concept:PropertyWriter">PropertyWriter</a> 
for graph is a functor which is called with one parameter, of type 
<tt>std::ostream</tt> and should print a series of graph properties. The following
code excerpt is an example of a PropertyWriter for a graph. 
<pre>
  struct sample_graph_writer {
    void operator()(std::ostream& out) const {
      out << "graph [bgcolor=lightgrey]" << std::endl;
      out << "node [shape=circle color=white]" << std::endl;
      out << "edge [style=dashed]" << std::endl;
    }
  };
}
</pre>

<p>
There exists a class <tt>default_writer</tt>, which can be used as both
vertex/edge and graph property write, and does nothing. It comes handy when
only edge properties must be written, but function interface requries to pass
vertex property writer as well.

Example
</H3>

This example demonstrates using BGL-graphviz interface to write 
a BGL graph into a graphviz format file.

<pre>
enum files_e { dax_h, yow_h, boz_h, zow_h, foo_cpp, 
               foo_o, bar_cpp, bar_o, libfoobar_a,
               zig_cpp, zig_o, zag_cpp, zag_o, 
                 libzigzag_a, killerapp, N };
const char* name[] = { "dax.h", "yow.h", "boz.h", "zow.h", "foo.cpp",
                       "foo.o", "bar.cpp", "bar.o", "libfoobar.a",
                       "zig.cpp", "zig.o", "zag.cpp", "zag.o",
                       "libzigzag.a", "killerapp" };

int main(int,char*[])
{
    
  typedef pair&lt;int,int&gt; Edge;
  Edge used_by[] = {
    Edge(dax_h, foo_cpp), Edge(dax_h, bar_cpp), Edge(dax_h, yow_h),
    Edge(yow_h, bar_cpp), Edge(yow_h, zag_cpp),
    Edge(boz_h, bar_cpp), Edge(boz_h, zig_cpp), Edge(boz_h, zag_cpp),
    Edge(zow_h, foo_cpp), 
    Edge(foo_cpp, foo_o),
    Edge(foo_o, libfoobar_a),
    Edge(bar_cpp, bar_o),
    Edge(bar_o, libfoobar_a),
    Edge(libfoobar_a, libzigzag_a),
    Edge(zig_cpp, zig_o),
    Edge(zig_o, libzigzag_a),
    Edge(zag_cpp, zag_o),
    Edge(zag_o, libzigzag_a),
    Edge(libzigzag_a, killerapp)
  };
  const int nedges = sizeof(used_by)/sizeof(Edge);
  int weights[nedges];
  fill(weights, weights + nedges, 1);

  typedef adjacency_list< vecS, vecS, directedS, 
      property< vertex_color_t, default_color_type >,
      property< edge_weight_t, int >
    > Graph;
  Graph g(N, used_by, used_by + nedges, weights);

  write_graphviz(std::cout, g, make_label_writer(name));
}
</pre>

The output will be:
<pre>
digraph G {
0 -> 4;
0 -> 6;
0 -> 1;
0 [label="dax.h"];
1 -> 6;
1 -> 11;
1 [label="yow.h"];
2 -> 6;
2 -> 9;
2 -> 11;
2 [label="boz.h"];
3 -> 4;
3 [label="zow.h"];
4 -> 5;
4 [label="foo.cpp"];
5 -> 8;
5 [label="foo.o"];
6 -> 7;
6 [label="bar.cpp"];
7 -> 8;
7 [label="bar.o"];
8 -> 13;
8 [label="libfoobar.a"];
9 -> 10;
9 [label="zig.cpp"];
10 -> 13;
10 [label="zig.o"];
11 -> 12;
11 [label="zag.cpp"];
12 -> 13;
12 [label="zag.o"];
13 -> 14;
13 [label="libzigzag.a"];
14;
14 [label="killerapp"];
edge[style="dotted"];
6 -> 0;
}
