<h1>History of the Boost Graph Library</h1>

The Boost Graph Library began its life as the Generic Graph Component
Library (GGCL), a software project at the <a
href="http://www.lsc.nd.edu">Lab for Scientific Computing (LSC)</a> at
the University of Notre Dame, under the direction of Professor <a
href="http://www.osl.iu.edu/~lums">Andrew Lumsdaine</a>. The Lab's
research directions include numerical linear algebra, parallel
computing, and software engineering (including generic programming).

<p>
Soon after the Standard Template Library was released, work began at
the LSC to apply generic programming to scientific computing.  The <a
href="http://www.lsc.nd.edu/research/mtl">Matrix Template Library</a>
(Jeremy Siek's masters thesis) was one of the first projects. Many of
the lessons learned during construction of the MTL were applied to the
design and implementation of the GGCL.

<p>
Graph algorithms play an important role in sparse matrix computations,
so the LSC had a need for a good graph library. However, none of the
available graph libraries (LEDA, GTL, Stanford GraphBase) were
written using the generic programming style of the STL, and hence did
not fulfill the flexibility and high-performance requirements of the
LSC. Others were also expressing interest in a generic C++ graph
library. During a meeting with Bjarne Stroustrup we were introduced to
several people at AT\&T who needed such a library. There had also been
earlier work in the area of generic graph algorithms, including some
codes written by Alexander Stepanov, and Dietmar K&uuml;hl's masters
thesis.

<p>
With this in mind, and motivated by homework assignments in his
algorithms class, Jeremy began prototyping an interface and some graph
classes in the spring on 1998. Lie-Quan Lee then developed the first
version of GGCL, which became his masters thesis project.

<p>
The following year, Jeremy went to work for SGI with Alexander
Stepanov and Matt Austern. During this time Alex's disjoint-sets based
connected components algorithm was added to GGCL, and Jeremy began
working on the concept documentation for GGCL similar to Matt's STL
documentation.

<p>
While working at SGI, Jeremy heard about Boost and was excited to find
a group of people interested in creating high-quality C++
libraries. At boost there were several people interested in generic
graph algorithms, most notably Dietmar K&uuml;hl.  Some discussions
about generic interfaces for graph structures resulted in the a
revision of GGCL which closely resembles the current Boost Graph
Library interface.

<p>
On September 4, 2000 GGCL passed the Boost formal review and became
the Boost Graph Library (BGL). The first release of BGL was
September 27, 2000.
