	<h4>Evaluated Parameter</h4>
	<div>
		An <i>evaluated parameter</i> is a numeric value that is evaluated by the library as a constant expression.&nbsp;
		This means that the expression can include simple arithmetic, logical, and condition expressions.&nbsp;
		It also means that the value of the parameter no longer depends on the source of the parameter.&nbsp;
		In other words, if the value is dependent on some macro, it will no longer be dependent on that macro after it is evaluated.&nbsp;
		This disables the lazy-evaluation that the preprocessor normallly uses.
