Peter Dimov contributed the <literal>bind</> functionality without which compile-time lambda expressions wouldn't have been possible. The &MPL; implementation would have been much more difficult without Vesa Karvonen's wonderful Boost Preprocessor Metaprogramming Library. Authors are also greatly indebted to David B. Held who kindly volunteered to thoroughly edit this document. Of course, any remaining errors are exclusively ours.
