
To re-generate the docs in the exact format as they appear here, you would
need a slightly tweaked DocBook XSLT stylesheets disrtibution available at 
http://www.mywikinet.com/mpl/docbook-xsl-1.50.0.zip

If you are to use the build scripts as-is, you also need these tools:

   sx - an SGML to XML convertor, a part of James Clark's SP package, 
        available at http://www.jclark.com/sp/

   msxsl - Microsoft XSLT processor, available at
           http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnxml/html/msxsl.asp

   tidy - http://tidy.sourceforge.net/
 
   Python - to be able to run 'tidy_attr.py', 
            available at http://www.python.org or 
            http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePython/
