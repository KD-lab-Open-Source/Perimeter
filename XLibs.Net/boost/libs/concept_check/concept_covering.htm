<h2><a name="concept-covering">Concept Covering and Archetypes</a></h2>

We have discussed how it is important to select the minimal
requirements (concepts) for the inputs to a component, but it is
equally important to verify that the chosen concepts <i>cover</i> the
algorithm. That is, any possible user error should be caught by the
concept checks and not let slip through.  Concept coverage can be
verified through the use of <i>archetype classes</i>. An archetype
class is an exact implementation of the interface associated with a
particular concept.  The run-time behavior of the archetype class is
not important, the functions can be left empty. A simple test program
can then be compiled with the archetype classes as the inputs to the
component. If the program compiles then one can be sure that the
concepts cover the component.

The following code shows the archetype class for the <a
href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/trivial.html">TrivialIterator</a>
concept. Some care must be taken to ensure that the archetype is an
exact match to the concept. For example, the concept states that the
return type of <tt>operator*()</tt> must be convertible to the value
type. It does not state the more stringent requirement that the return
type be <tt>T&amp;</tt> or <tt>const T&amp;</tt>. That means it would be a
mistake to use <tt>T&amp;</tt> or <tt>const T&amp;</tt> for the return type
of the archetype class. The correct approach is to create an
artificial return type that is convertible to <tt>T</tt>, as we have
done here with <tt>input_proxy</tt>. The validity of the archetype
class test is completely dependent on it being an exact match with the
concept, which must be verified by careful (manual) inspection.

<pre>
  template &lt;class T&gt;
  struct input_proxy {
    operator const T&() {
      return static_object&lt;T&gt;::get(); // Get a reference without constructing
    }
  };
  template &lt;class T&gt;
  class trivial_iterator_archetype
  {
    typedef trivial_iterator_archetype self;
  public:
    trivial_iterator_archetype() { }
    trivial_iterator_archetype(const self&) { }
    self& operator=(const self&) { return *this;  }
    friend bool operator==(const self&, const self&) { return true; }
    friend bool operator!=(const self&, const self&) { return true; }
    input_proxy&lt;T&gt; operator*() { return input_proxy&lt;T&gt;(); }
  };

  namespace std {
    template &lt;class T&gt;
    struct iterator_traits&lt; trivial_iterator_archetype&lt;T&gt; &gt;
    {
      typedef T value_type;
    };
  }
</pre>

Generic algorithms are often tested by being instantiated with a
number of common input types. For example, one might apply
<tt>std::stable_sort()</tt> with basic pointer types as the iterators.
Though appropriate for testing the run-time behavior of the algorithm,
this is not helpful for ensuring concept coverage because C++ types
never match particular concepts, they often provide much more than the
minimal functionality required by any one concept. That is, even
though the function template compiles with a given type, the concept
requirements may still fall short of covering the functions actual
requirements. This is why it is important to compile with archetype
classes in addition to testing with common input types.

<p>
The following is an excerpt from <a
href="./stl_concept_covering.cpp"><tt>stl_concept_covering.cpp</tt></a>
that shows how archetypes can be used to check the requirement
documentation for
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/stable_sort.html">
<tt>std::stable_sort()</tt></a>. In this case, it looks like the <a
href="../utility/CopyConstructible.html">CopyConstructible</a> and <a
href="../utility/Assignable.html">Assignable</a> requirements were
forgotten in the SGI STL documentation (try removing those
archetypes).  The Boost archetype classes have been designed so that
they can be layered.  In this example the value type of the iterator
is composed out of three archetypes. In the archetype class reference
below, template parameters named <tt>Base</tt> indicate where the
layered archetype can be used.

<pre>
  {
    typedef less_than_comparable_archetype&lt; 
        sgi_assignable_archetype&lt;&gt; &gt; ValueType;
    random_access_iterator_archetype&lt;ValueType&gt; ri;
    std::stable_sort(ri, ri);
  }
</pre>
