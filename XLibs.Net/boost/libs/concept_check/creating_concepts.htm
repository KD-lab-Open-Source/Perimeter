<h2><a name="creating-concept-checks">Creating Concept Checking Classes</a></h2>

As an example of how to create a concept checking class, we look
at how to create the corresponding checks for the
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/RandomAccessIterator.html">
RandomAccessIterator</a> concept. First, as a convention we name the
concept checking class after the concept, and add the suffix
``<tt>Concept</tt>''. Next we must define a member function named
<tt>constraints()</tt> in which we will exercise the valid expressions
of the concept. <tt>function_requires()</tt> expects this function's
signature to appear exactly as it is appears below: a <tt>void</tt>
non-const member function with no parameters.

<p>
The first part of the <tt>constraints()</tt> function includes
the requirements that correspond to the <i>refinement</i> relationship
between <a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/RandomAccessIterator.html">
RandomAccessIterator</a> and the concepts which it builds upon:
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/BidirectionalIterator.html">
BidirectionalIterator</a> and
<a href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/LessThanComparable.html">
LessThanComparable</a>. We could have instead used
<tt>BOOST_CLASS_REQUIRE</tt> and placed these requirements in the class
body, however <tt>BOOST_CLASS_REQUIRE</tt> uses C++ language features that
are less portable.

<p>
Next we check that the <tt>iterator_category</tt> of the iterator is
either <tt>std::random_access_iterator_tag</tt> or a derived class.
After that we write out some code that corresponds to the valid
expressions of the <a
href="http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/RandomAccessIterator.html">
RandomAccessIterator</a> concept. Typedefs can also be added to
enforce the associated types of the concept.

<pre>
  template &lt;class Iter&gt;
  struct RandomAccessIterator_concept
  {
    void constraints() {
      function_requires&lt; BidirectionalIteratorConcept&lt;Iter&gt; &gt;();
      function_requires&lt; LessThanComparableConcept&lt;Iter&gt; &gt;();
      function_requires&lt; ConvertibleConcept&lt;
        typename std::iterator_traits&lt;Iter&gt;::iterator_category,
        std::random_access_iterator_tag&gt; &gt;();

      i += n;
      i = i + n; i = n + i;
      i -= n;
      i = i - n;
      n = i - j;
      i[n];
    }
    Iter i, j;
    typename std::iterator_traits&lt;Iter&gt;::difference_type n;
  };
}
</pre>

One potential pitfall in designing concept checking classes is using
more expressions in the constraint function than necessary. For
example, it is easy to accidentally use the default constructor to
create the objects that will be needed in the expressions (and not all
concepts require a default constructor). This is the reason we write
the constraint function as a member function of a class. The objects
involved in the expressions are declared as data members of the class.
Since objects of the constraints class template are never
instantiated, the default constructor for the concept checking class
is never instantiated. Hence the data member's default constructors
are never instantiated (C++ Standard Section 14.7.1 9).
